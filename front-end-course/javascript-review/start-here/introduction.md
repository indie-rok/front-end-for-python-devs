# Introduction

I welcome you to this new adventure of learning Front End development.

Over the next 10 weeks, we will embark in an adventure of understanding the Javascript, CSS and HTML.

We will discover the main use cases, best practices and techniques that will allow us to create beautiful, fast and functional UIs (User Interface) for any web application.

I would like to start by distinguishing between this 3 languages, how do they look like and what do they do.
