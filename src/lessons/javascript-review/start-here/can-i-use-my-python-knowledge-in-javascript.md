# Can i use my python knowledge in javascript

Yes, in the next lessons, we will cover the basics of javascript, but keep the following page bookmarked, because many of the concepts we will see, probably you've already seen while learning Python.

1. Data Types (primitives)

| Python Concept | Python Example | JavaScript Concept | JavaScript Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Integer | x = 5 | Number | let x = 5; |
| Float | y = 3.14 | Number | let y = 3.14; |
| String | s = 'hello' | String | let s = 'hello'; |
| Boolean | b = True | Boolean | let b = true; |

2. Data operations

| Python Concept | Python Example | JavaScript Concept | JavaScript Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Addition | result = x + y | Addition | let result = x + y; |
| Subtraction | result = x - y | Subtraction | let result = x - y; |
| Multiplication | result = x * y | Multiplication | let result = x * y; |
| Division | result = x / y | Division | let result = x / y; |

3. Variables

| Python Concept | Python Example | JavaScript Concept | JavaScript Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Variable assignment | x = 10 | Variable assignment | let x = 10; |
| Constants | X = 10 | Constants | const X = 10; |

4. Conditionals

| Python Concept | Python Example | JavaScript Concept | JavaScript Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| If-else | if x > 0: print("Positive") | If-else | if (x > 0) { console.log("Positive"); } |
|  | else: print("Non-positive") |  | else { console.log("Non-positive"); } |

5. Loops

| Python Concept | Python Example | JavaScript Concept | JavaScript Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| For loop | for i in range(3): print(i) | For loop | for (let i = 0; i < 3; i++) { console.log(i); } |
| While loop | while x > 0: x -= 1 | While loop | while (x > 0) { x--; } |

6. Functions

| Python Concept | Python Example | JavaScript Concept | JavaScript Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Function definition | def func(): return "Hello" | Function definition | function func() { return "Hello"; } |

7. Data structures (Array, objects)

| Python Concept | Python Example | JavaScript Concept | JavaScript Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| List (Array) | my_list = [1, 2, 3] | Array | let myArray = [1, 2, 3]; |
| Dictionary (Object) | my_dict = {"key": "value"} | Object | let myObject = {"key": "value"}; |
| List of Dictionaries | my_list = [{"key1": "value1"}, {"key2": "value2"}] | Array of Objects | let myArray = [{"key1": "value1"}, {"key2": "value2"}]; |

8. Built-in methods for strings

| Python Concept | Python Example | JavaScript Concept | JavaScript Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| String length | length = len(s) | String length | let length = s.length; |
| String concatenation | combined = s1 + s2 | String concatenation | let combined = s1 + s2; |
| String find | index = s.find('llo') | String indexOf | let index = s.indexOf('llo'); |

9. Built-in methods for arrays

| Python Concept | Python Example | JavaScript Concept | JavaScript Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Append to array | my_list.append(4) | Push to array | myArray.push(4); |
| Remove from array | my_list.remove(2) | Splice from array | myArray.splice(myArray.indexOf(2), 1); |
| Array length | length = len(my_list) | Array length | let length = myArray.length; |
| Access array element | element = my_list[0] | Access array element | let element = myArray[0]; |
| Sort array | my_list.sort() | Sort array | myArray.sort(); |
| Reverse array | my_list.reverse() | Reverse array | myArray.reverse(); |
