<p>Let's start by distinguishing between these three languages, how they look like, and what they do.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-html-css-and-js"><a class="header" href="#what-are-html-css-and-js">What are HTML, CSS, and JS?</a></h2>
<p><img src="lessons/javascript-review/./what-is-html-css-and-js.png" alt="What is HTML, CSS, and JS?" /></p>
<p>So in summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>HTML gives structure to a website. (like what would be the order of an element)</li>
<li>CSS makes it pretty (like the color of my elements)</li>
<li>JS makes it interactive (what happens if I click a button)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-learn-javascript"><a class="header" href="#why-learn-javascript">Why Learn JavaScript?</a></h2>
<p>Although this course is focused on web applications, many of the principles can be used for other platforms. JavaScript is a very powerful programming language that, with the right tools, could allow you to create <a href="https://reactnative.dev/">mobile apps</a>, <a href="https://www.electronjs.org/es/">desktop apps</a>, <a href="https://www.bouvet.no/bouvet-deler/utbrudd/learning-javascript-and-arduino-programming-with-johnny-five">program robots</a> or <a href="https://expressjs.com/">create powerful back ends</a>. </p>
<p>Not to mention it's <a href="https://www.devjobsscanner.com/blog/top-8-most-demanded-languages-in-2022/">one of the most</a> demanded programming languages for professional job opportunities and it's easy-to-learn syntax, it was the obvious choice when choosing a programming language for writing web applications. Even with interesting alternatives like <a href="https://dart.dev/">Dart</a> or <a href="https://webassembly.org/">Web Assembly</a>, JavaScript is still the number one choice for everything related to front end programming.</p>

<p>Welcome to our section on JavaScript basics. JavaScript is a key language for web development, and understanding its core concepts is important if you want to build websites or web apps.</p>
<p>In this section, we'll start by looking at basic data types like numbers, strings, and more. We'll see how we can do different things with these data types, such as adding numbers or combining strings.</p>
<p>Next, we'll learn about variables. Think of them as small boxes where we can store our data. We'll also do some exercises on this topic to get hands-on practice.</p>
<p>After that, we'll go into how we can use conditionals and loops to control what our code does and how many times it does it. We'll then see how functions let us group code together to use again and again.</p>
<p>We'll also talk about some more complex ways to store data using arrays and objects.</p>
<p>Finally, we'll have a quick chat about different versions of JavaScript, like ES6 and ES2015. We'll wrap up with some questions to test what you've learned. Let's dive in!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="information-type-and-operations"><a class="header" href="#information-type-and-operations">Information Type and Operations</a></h1>
<h2 id="learning-objectives"><a class="header" href="#learning-objectives">Learning objectives</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Understand what is meant by <em>values</em> in JavaScript.</li>
<li>Learn about the different data types in JavaScript.</li>
<li>Learn how to combine and transform values with operators in JavaScript.</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h2 id="data-type"><a class="header" href="#data-type">Data type</a></h2>
<p>Computers handle billions of bits. To make it easier to manage large amounts of bits, we can divide them into &quot;pieces&quot; that represent pieces of information. In a JavaScript environment, these pieces are called <em><strong>values</strong></em>. Each <em>value</em> has a <em>data type</em> that determines its role. In JavaScript, there are five (5) primitive data types:</p>
<ol>
<li><code>number</code></li>
<li><code>string</code> (text).</li>
<li><code>boolean</code></li>
<li><code>undefined</code></li>
<li><code>null</code></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<p>These values are called primitives because they allow the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primitive_data_type">creation of other values</a>. i.e if you add 2 numbers, you get a new number. But what happens if you add two strings? <code>🤔</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worth mentioning that every programming language has its primitives. <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/data-structures-python">Python has 4</a>. <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/datatypes.html">Java has 8</a>. They allow us to organize information and determine how the program should run. In this lesson, you will learn how to define and manipulate these types of data.</p>
<p>We are going to make operations with these primitive values to create new information. Adding a number. Organizing a text, etc</p>
<h2 id="1-numbers"><a class="header" href="#1-numbers">1. Numbers</a></h2>
<p>Values of type <code>number</code> are, unsurprisingly, numerical values. That is, pieces of data that represent numerical information are represented with the <code>number</code> type. This includes positive and negative numbers, integers, and decimals. In addition, the <code>number</code> data type has three symbolic values: <code>+Infinity</code>, <code>-Infinity</code>, and <code>NaN</code> (not-a-number).</p>
<p>Let's see several examples. Open your console (remember writing <code>node</code> in your terminal) and write the following numbers. As you do so, the console returns the number to you.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">13// returns: 
13-9.81// retorna: -9.81
</code></pre>
<h3 id="arithmetic-operators"><a class="header" href="#arithmetic-operators">Arithmetic Operators</a></h3>
<p>The main operation done with numbers is arithmetic operations. Let's continue exploring the behavior of the <code>number</code> data type in your console. Write the following example in your console and confirm that you get the same result:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">100 + 4 * 11// returns: 144
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>+</code> and <code>*</code> symbols are also called <em>operators</em>. The first represents addition and the second represents multiplication. When you put an operator between two values, the operation is applied to those values and produces a new value. As you can see, multiplication happens first. But like in math, you can change this by enclosing the addition in parentheses.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">(100 + 4) * 11// returns: 1144
</code></pre>
<p>For subtraction, there is the <code>-</code> operator, and division can be done with the <code>/</code> operator. Let's see more examples (remember to try them in your console too!):</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">12345 / 250// returns: 49.38
57 * 3 - 31 / 4 // returns: 163.25
100 / -0 // returns: -Infinity
1000 * Infinity// returns: Infinity
0/0 // returns: NaN
Infinity - Infinity// returns: NaN
</code></pre>
<p>There is also one more arithmetic operator that you might not immediately recognize. The <code>%</code> symbol is used to represent the <em>remainder</em> operation. X % Y results in the remainder of dividing X by Y. For example, 314 % 100 produces 14 (because 100 times 3 plus 14 equals 314), and 144 % 12 gives 0 (because 12 times 12 plus 0 equals 144). You will often see this operator referred to as <em>modulo</em>, although technically remainder is more accurate.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">5 % 3// returns: 27 % 2// returns: 1
</code></pre>
<h2 id="2-strings"><a class="header" href="#2-strings">2. Strings</a></h2>
<p>The next basic data type is <code>String</code>, which refers to a <em>string of characters</em> and is used to represent text. They are declared by placing the content between quotes.</p>
<p>Open your console and type the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">'Hola, my name is Luke'// returns: &quot;Hola, my name is Luke&quot;
'I am a web developer'// returns: &quot;I am a web developer&quot;
&quot;123&quot;// returns: &quot;123&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Both single and double quotes can be used to declare <code>strings</code>, as long as they match at the beginning and end.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>Pro tip:</strong></p>
<p>We can use both single (<code>'</code>) and double (<code>&quot;</code>) quotes to delimit our strings, but conventionally, in each project we choose to use either one or the other and try to be consistent. This helps with the <em>clarity</em> and <em>maintainability</em> of the code in the long run. In our case, <strong>we will choose single quotes from here on.</strong></p>
<hr />
<p>Text strings cannot be divided numerically, multiplied, or subtracted, but the <code>+</code> character can be used on them. It does not add, but concatenates; it joins two <code>strings</code>. The following line produces the <code>string</code> &quot;concatenate&quot;:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">'cats' + 'up' + ' ' + 'yomi'// returns: &quot;catsup yomi&quot;
// note the empty space that it is also a string in the 3rd position
</code></pre>
<p>Be careful mixing operations between <em>numbers</em> and <em>strings</em>. For example, multiplying a <em>number</em> by a <em>string</em> results in <code>NaN</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">'hola' * 3// returns: NaN
</code></pre>
<h2 id="3-booleans"><a class="header" href="#3-booleans">3. Booleans</a></h2>
<p>Often, you will need a value that simply distinguishes between two possibilities, such as &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; or &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot;. For this, JavaScript has a <em>boolean</em> data type, which has only two values: <em>true</em> and <em>false</em>.</p>
<h3 id="comparison-operators"><a class="header" href="#comparison-operators">Comparison Operators</a></h3>
<p>Perform the following comparison in your console:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">3 &gt; 2// returns: true
2 &gt; 3// returns: false
typeof (3 &gt; 2)// returns: &quot;boolean&quot;
typeof (2 &gt; 3)// returns: &quot;boolean&quot;
5 == 5 // returns: true
</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>typeof is an special command of Javascriot that will tell you what data type you have i.e typeof &quot;hello”, will return string</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="difference-between--and-"><a class="header" href="#difference-between--and-">Difference between == and ===</a></h4>
<p><code>==</code> and <code>===</code> are comparison operators, and they have a fundamental difference in the way they compare two values.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Double Equals (==)</strong>: This is a loose equality comparison operator in JavaScript. It compares two values for equality, after performing any necessary type conversions. This means that if you are comparing a number and a string, JavaScript will attempt to convert the string to a number before making the comparison.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">    console.log(5 == &quot;5&quot;); // true, because &quot;5&quot; is coerced to the number 5
    console.log(true == 1); // true, because true is coerced to the number 1
</code></pre>
<ol start="2">
<li><strong>Triple Equals (===)</strong>: This is a strict equality comparison operator in JavaScript. It compares two values for equality, without performing any type conversion. If the types of the two values are different, it will always return <code>false</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-javascript">    console.log(5 === &quot;5&quot;); // false, because no type coercion is done
    console.log(true === 1); // false, because true (boolean) is not the same type as 1 (number)
</code></pre>
<p>In general, it's a good practice to use <code>===</code> in JavaScript, because it avoids strange bugs that can occur due to unexpected type conversion.</p>
<p><code>Strings</code> can be compared in the same way.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">&quot;Aardvark&quot; &lt; &quot;Zoroaster&quot;// returns: true

</code></pre>
<p>The way <code>strings</code> are ordered is more or less alphabetically: uppercase letters are always &quot;less than&quot; lowercase letters, so <code>'Z' &lt; 'a'</code> is true, and non-alphabetic characters (<code>!</code>, <code>-</code>, and so on) are also included in the ordering. The actual comparison is based on the <a href="https://unicode-table.com/en/#control-character">Unicode</a> standard.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">'Zeyla' &lt; 'ana'// returns: true
'Zeyla' &lt; '!na'// returns: false
</code></pre>
<p>Other similar operators are <code>&gt;=</code> (greater than or equal to), <code>&lt;=</code> (less than or equal to), <code>==</code> (equal to), and <code>!=</code> (not equal to).</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">'Itchy' == 'Itchy'// returns: true
'Itchy' != 'Scratchy'// returns: true
5 == 5// returns: true
10 != 'diez'// returns: true
</code></pre>
<p>The intention of NaN is to represent the result of a nonsensical calculation and as such, is not equal to the result of any other nonsensical calculation.</p>
<h3 id="logical-operators"><a class="header" href="#logical-operators">Logical Operators</a></h3>
<p>There are also some operations that can be applied to <code>Booleans</code>. JavaScript supports three logical operators: <em>and</em>, <em>or</em>, and <em>not</em>. These can be used to &quot;reason&quot; with <code>Booleans</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator represents the <em>and</em> logical operation. It is a binary operator, and its result is <em>true</em> only if both given values are true. The <code>||</code> operator denotes the <em>or</em> logical operation. It returns true if either of the two given values are true. <em>Not</em> (Negation) is written as an exclamation point <code>!</code>. It is a binary operator that flips the value it is given; !true produces false and <code>!false</code> produces true. Let's see some examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">true &amp;&amp; true// returns: true
true &amp;&amp; false// returns: false
false &amp;&amp; false// returns: false
true || true// returns: true
true || false// returns: true
!true// returns: false
!false// returns: true
</code></pre>
<p>The last logical operator you will learn is not unary or binary, but ternary and operates on three values. This is written with a question mark and a colon, like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">true ? 1 : 2// returns: 1
false ? 1 : 2// returns: 2

</code></pre>
<p>This is called the conditional operator (or sometimes the ternary operator since it is the only operator of its kind in the language). The value to the left of the question mark &quot;chooses&quot; which of the other two values will result. When it is true, the middle value is chosen, and when it is false, the value to the right is the result.</p>
<h2 id="4-null-and-undefined"><a class="header" href="#4-null-and-undefined">4. Null and Undefined</a></h2>
<p>There are two special values, <code>null</code> and <code>undefined</code>, which are used to denote the absence of a significant value. They are values themselves, but they do not have any information. Many operations in the language that do not produce a meaningful value (you will see this later) produce <code>undefined</code> simply because they have to produce some value.</p>
<p>The difference in meaning between <code>undefined</code> and <code>null</code> is a JavaScript design accident and does not matter most of the time.</p>
<p>Understanding the difference between <code>undefined</code> and <code>null</code> (yes, there is a semantic difference) is important, and easier than it seems. Both values denote the absence of a value, but in one case, we could say that it is <em>intentional</em> (<code>null</code>), and in the other, it is not (<code>undefined</code>).</p>
<p>The value <code>undefined</code> means that a value has not been assigned, as opposed to <code>null</code>, which means that we have assigned a null value. This can be very useful for differentiating states in asynchronous operations, ... it is common for <code>undefined</code> to mean that the operation has not yet been completed, while <code>null</code> means that it has completed but returned a null value.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="variables"><a class="header" href="#variables">Variables</a></h1>
<p>As a Python developer, you're already familiar with the concept of variables - named containers that store data or values. In JavaScript, the principle is the same, but there are differences in syntax and behavior that we'll examine in this article.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="declaring-variables"><a class="header" href="#declaring-variables">Declaring Variables</a></h2>
<p>In Python, you declare a variable by simply assigning it a value, like so:</p>
<pre><code>x = 10
</code></pre>
<p>In JavaScript, we have three keywords for declaring variables: <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>const</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">var x = 10;
let y = 20;
const z = 30;

</code></pre>
<p>Note the semicolon at the end of each statement. While not strictly necessary in JavaScript, it's generally good practice to use them to avoid potential issues.</p>
<h2 id="var-let-and-const"><a class="header" href="#var-let-and-const">Var, Let, and Const</a></h2>
<p>Now, you may be wondering about the difference between <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>const</code>. Here's a brief overview:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>var:</strong> This is the oldest way to declare variables in JavaScript. Variables declared with <code>var</code> are function-scoped, meaning they are only available within the function they're declared in. If declared outside a function, they are globally scoped. They can also be redeclared and updated.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">var a = 10;
var a = 20; // This is allowed
</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>let:</strong> Introduced in ES6, <code>let</code> provides block scoping. Variables declared with <code>let</code> are only available within the block they're declared in. They can't be redeclared within the same scope, but they can be updated.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let b = 10;
let b = 20; // This will throw an error
b = 20; // But this is allowed

</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><strong>const:</strong> Also introduced in ES6, <code>const</code> stands for constant. <code>const</code> variables must be initialized during declaration and can't be updated or redeclared.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">const c = 10;
c = 20; // This will throw an error
</code></pre>
<h2 id="hoisting"><a class="header" href="#hoisting">Hoisting</a></h2>
<p>An important difference between JavaScript and Python is the concept of hoisting. In JavaScript, variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their containing scope during the compile phase. This means that you can use a variable before it's declared.</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">f = 10;
var f; // No error - 'f' is hoisted to the top of the scope

</code></pre>
<p>However, only the declarations are hoisted, not the initializations. This can lead to unexpected results:</p>
<pre><code class="language-js">console.log(g); // undefined
var g = 10;

</code></pre>
<p>In this example, <code>g</code> is hoisted and declared at the top of the scope, but it's not initialized until the assignment statement. So, the value of <code>g</code> is <code>undefined</code> when it's logged.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while JavaScript's variable declaration and handling may seem different from Python's, they both follow logical rules that can be easily understood with a bit of practice. The keywords <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>const</code> each have their place in a developer's toolkit, giving you options to define the scope and mutability of your variables as needed.</p>
<h2 id="scope-in-javascript"><a class="header" href="#scope-in-javascript">Scope in JavaScript</a></h2>
<p>Let's dive deeper into the concept of variable scope in JavaScript. Unlike Python, where indentation determines a block, JavaScript uses <code>{}</code> to create a new block. Variables declared with <code>let</code> and <code>const</code> are block-scoped, meaning they exist only within the block where they are defined.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">{
  let blockScoped = &quot;Hello&quot;;
  const alsoBlockScoped = &quot;World&quot;;
}

console.log(blockScoped); // Error: blockScoped is not defined
console.log(alsoBlockScoped); // Error: alsoBlockScoped is not defined
</code></pre>
<p>On the other hand, <code>var</code> variables are function-scoped, as mentioned before. If a <code>var</code> variable is declared outside any function, it becomes globally scoped and can be accessed anywhere in your code, which can potentially lead to issues.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">var functionScoped = &quot;Hello&quot;;

function logVar() {
  console.log(functionScoped); // &quot;Hello&quot;
}

logVar();

</code></pre>
<p>In conclusion, transitioning from Python to JavaScript when dealing with variables may take some practice. However, once you understand the different behaviors and scopes associated with <code>var</code>, <code>let</code>, and <code>const</code>, you'll be able to write more flexible and robust code in JavaScript.</p>
<hr />
<p>Remember, the differences aren't bad – they're simply different tools in your toolkit, each with their best use-cases. Happy coding!</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="conditionals"><a class="header" href="#conditionals">Conditionals</a></h1>
<p>As a Python developer, you're already familiar with conditional statements – blocks of code that run based on whether certain conditions are true or false. The concept in JavaScript remains the same, but with a few key differences that we'll discuss in this article.</p>
<h2 id="the-if-statement"><a class="header" href="#the-if-statement">The <code>if</code> Statement</a></h2>
<p>The <code>if</code> statement in JavaScript functions similarly to Python. Here's a side-by-side comparison:</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x = 10
if x &gt; 5:
    print(&quot;x is greater than 5&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let x = 10;
if (x &gt; 5) {
    console.log(&quot;x is greater than 5&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The syntax in JavaScript requires parentheses around the condition, unlike Python. Also, you'll notice that JavaScript uses curly braces <code>{}</code> to denote the block of code associated with the condition, and the line ends with a semicolon.</p>
<h2 id="else-and-else-if"><a class="header" href="#else-and-else-if"><code>else</code> and <code>else if</code></a></h2>
<p>Just like Python, JavaScript has <code>else</code> and <code>else if</code> clauses. These work very similarly to their Python counterparts.</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x = 10
if x &gt; 10:
    print(&quot;x is greater than 10&quot;)
elif x == 10:
    print(&quot;x is exactly 10&quot;)
else:
    print(&quot;x is less than 10&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let x = 10;
if (x &gt; 10) {
    console.log(&quot;x is greater than 10&quot;);
} else if (x === 10) {
    console.log(&quot;x is exactly 10&quot;);
} else {
    console.log(&quot;x is less than 10&quot;);
}

</code></pre>
<p>Note that <code>elif</code> in Python is equivalent to <code>else if</code> in JavaScript. Also, <code>==</code> in JavaScript performs type coercion and checks for equality of value, but not type. The <code>===</code> operator checks for equality of both value and type.</p>
<h2 id="switch-case"><a class="header" href="#switch-case">Switch Case</a></h2>
<p>JavaScript has a <code>switch</code> statement, which is used to perform different actions based on different conditions. Python doesn't have a built-in switch case statement, and it is often simulated using if..elif..else chains or dictionaries.</p>
<p>Here's a simple example of a <code>switch</code> statement in JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let fruit = &quot;Apple&quot;;

switch(fruit) {
    case &quot;Apple&quot;:
        console.log(&quot;Red&quot;);
        break;
    case &quot;Banana&quot;:
        console.log(&quot;Yellow&quot;);
        break;
    default:
        console.log(&quot;Unknown fruit&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>switch</code> statement evaluates an expression and checks it against different <code>case</code> values. If there's a match, the corresponding block of code is executed. The <code>break</code> keyword is used to exit the switch case. Without it, the program will continue to the next case, causing potentially unwanted behavior. The <code>default</code> keyword specifies code to run if there's no match.</p>
<h2 id="truthy-and-falsy-values"><a class="header" href="#truthy-and-falsy-values">Truthy and Falsy Values</a></h2>
<p>In JavaScript, all values have an inherent boolean truthiness or falsiness. This differs from Python, which has a specific set of rules for what evaluates to <code>True</code> or <code>False</code>.</p>
<p>In JavaScript, the falsy values are <code>false</code>, <code>0</code>, <code>&quot;&quot;</code> (empty string), <code>null</code>, <code>undefined</code>, and <code>NaN</code>. Everything else is truthy.</p>
<p>This is important to understand because it impacts how conditions are evaluated in JavaScript. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let name = &quot;&quot;;
if (name) {
    console.log(&quot;Hello, &quot; + name);
} else {
    console.log(&quot;No name provided&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, if <strong><code>name</code></strong> is an empty string, the message &quot;No name provided&quot; will be logged to the console.</p>
<h2 id="ternary-operator"><a class="header" href="#ternary-operator"><strong>Ternary Operator</strong></a></h2>
<p>JavaScript, like Python, has a ternary operator for handling simple conditional logic in a concise way. Here's a comparison:</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-python">x = 10
message = &quot;x is 10&quot; if x == 10 else &quot;x is not 10&quot;
</code></pre>
<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let x = 10;
let message = x === 10 ? &quot;x is 10&quot; : &quot;x is not 10&quot;;
</code></pre>
<p>The syntax is slightly different, but the concept is the same: evaluate a condition and return one value if it's true, and another value if it's false.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="loops"><a class="header" href="#loops">Loops</a></h1>
<p>In Python, you're likely familiar with loops, structures that allow you to repeat blocks of code. JavaScript also employs loops with a similar purpose but different syntax and behavior. In this article, we'll explore the various types of loops in JavaScript, comparing them to their Python equivalents.</p>
<h2 id="for-loop"><a class="header" href="#for-loop">For Loop</a></h2>
<p>The <code>for</code> loop is a common type of loop in JavaScript, with similar semantics to Python but different syntax.</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-python">for i in range(5):
    print(i)
</code></pre>
<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">for (let i = 0; i &lt; 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
</code></pre>
<p>In JavaScript, the <code>for</code> loop has three components within the parentheses: the initialization (usually of the loop counter), the condition (which, while true, allows the loop to continue), and the final expression (usually incrementing the counter).</p>
<h2 id="while-loop"><a class="header" href="#while-loop">While Loop</a></h2>
<p>The <code>while</code> loop in JavaScript is quite similar to Python.</p>
<p><strong>Python:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">i = 0
while i &lt; 5:
    print(i)
    i += 1

</code></pre>
<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let i = 0;
while (i &lt; 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>while</code> loop continues to run as long as the condition in parentheses is true. Note that JavaScript uses <code>++</code> for incrementing a variable, though <code>+=</code> is also valid.</p>
<h2 id="dowhile-loop"><a class="header" href="#dowhile-loop">Do...While Loop</a></h2>
<p>The <code>do...while</code> loop is unique to JavaScript and doesn't have a direct equivalent in Python. This loop will execute the block of code <strong>once</strong> and then continue to repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.</p>
<p><strong>JavaScript:</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let i = 0;
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while (i &lt; 5);

</code></pre>
<p>In this example, even if <code>i</code> starts greater than 5, the block of code inside the <code>do</code> loop will still run once.</p>
<h2 id="forin-loop-and-forof-loop"><a class="header" href="#forin-loop-and-forof-loop">For...In Loop and For...Of Loop</a></h2>
<p>In JavaScript, there are two additional loop structures, <code>for...in</code> and <code>for...of</code>, which are somewhat similar to Python's <code>for</code> loop when used with collections.</p>
<p>The <code>for...in</code> loop is used to iterate over the enumerable properties of an object:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let obj = {a: 1, b: 2, c: 3};
for (let prop in obj) {
    console.log(prop + &quot;: &quot; + obj[prop]);
}

</code></pre>
<p>This loop will print the name and value of each property in the object.</p>
<p>The <code>for...of</code> loop is used to iterate over iterable objects, like arrays or strings:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
for (let value of arr) {
    console.log(value);
}
</code></pre>
<p>This loop will print each value in the array. Note that <code>for...of</code> <strong>cannot</strong> be used with regular objects because they are not iterable.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="functions"><a class="header" href="#functions">Functions</a></h1>
<p>If you're coming from a Python background, you're likely already familiar with the concept of functions - reusable blocks of code designed to perform a certain task. JavaScript functions operate on the same principle but with some differences in terms of syntax and behavior. Let's delve into it.</p>
<h2 id="function-declaration"><a class="header" href="#function-declaration">Function Declaration</a></h2>
<p>In JavaScript, a function can be declared using the <code>function</code> keyword:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function greet() {
    console.log(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
}

</code></pre>
<p>To call this function, you would use <code>greet()</code>.</p>
<p>This is equivalent to the following Python code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-python">def greet():
    print(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)
</code></pre>
<p>And similarly, you'd call it using <code>greet()</code>.</p>
<h2 id="parameters-and-arguments"><a class="header" href="#parameters-and-arguments">Parameters and Arguments</a></h2>
<p>Like Python, JavaScript functions can take parameters and be called with arguments. However, JavaScript is more lenient with argument count mismatch:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function greet(name) {
    console.log(&quot;Hello, &quot; + name);
}

greet(&quot;Alice&quot;);
greet(); // This is allowed in JavaScript
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, calling <code>greet()</code> with no arguments logs &quot;Hello, undefined&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="return-values"><a class="header" href="#return-values">Return Values</a></h2>
<p>JavaScript functions, like their Python counterparts, can return a value using the <code>return</code> statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function add(x, y) {
    return x + y;
}

let sum = add(5, 3);
console.log(sum); // 8

</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>If a JavaScript function doesn't have a <code>return</code> statement, it returns <code>undefined</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="function-expressions"><a class="header" href="#function-expressions">Function Expressions</a></h2>
<p>JavaScript has a concept called function expressions, where a function is assigned to a variable:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let greet = function(name) {
    console.log(&quot;Hello, &quot; + name);
};

greet(&quot;Alice&quot;);
</code></pre>
<p>Function expressions can be anonymous (function without name), as seen above, or named (function with name).</p>
<h2 id="arrow-functions"><a class="header" href="#arrow-functions">Arrow Functions</a></h2>
<p>Introduced in <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_es6.asp">ES6</a>, arrow functions provide a more compact syntax for function expressions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let greet = (name) =&gt; {
    console.log(&quot;Hello, &quot; + name);
};

greet(&quot;Alice&quot;);

</code></pre>
<p>If there's only one parameter, you can omit the parentheses:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let greet = name =&gt; {
    console.log(&quot;Hello, &quot; + name);
};
</code></pre>
<p>If the function body only contains one statement, you can omit the curly braces and the <code>return</code> keyword:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let add = (x, y) =&gt; x + y;

let sum = add(5, 3);
console.log(sum); // 8

</code></pre>
<h2 id="callback-functions"><a class="header" href="#callback-functions">Callback Functions</a></h2>
<p>JavaScript heavily uses callback functions, which are functions passed as arguments to other functions. Callbacks are often used in event handling and asynchronous operations.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function greet(callback) {
    console.log(&quot;Hello, world!&quot;);
    callback();
}

greet(function() {
    console.log(&quot;This runs after the greet function.&quot;);
});

// logs:
// Hello, world!
// This runs after the greet function.
</code></pre>
<h2 id="closure"><a class="header" href="#closure">Closure</a></h2>
<p>JavaScript functions create their own scope for variables – they can access their own local variables, variables from their parent (enclosing) scope, and global variables. This capability to remember and access its lexical scope even when the function is executing outside its lexical scope is known as closure.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function makeGreetingFunction(name) {
    let message = &quot;Hello, &quot; + name + &quot;!&quot;;
    return function() {
        console.log(message);
    };
}

let greetAlice = makeGreetingFunction(&quot;Alice&quot;);
greetAlice(); // &quot;Hello, Alice!&quot;

</code></pre>
<p>If it's a bit abstract, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vKJpN5FAeF4">this video</a> might be helpful, to elaborate what a closure is and how to use it.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="complex-data-structures-array-objects"><a class="header" href="#complex-data-structures-array-objects">Complex Data Structures Array Objects</a></h1>
<p>If you are a Python developer looking to understand JavaScript, you likely know about Lists of Dictionaries. In JavaScript, an equivalent construct is the Array of Objects. Let's delve into this topic.</p>
<h2 id="arrays-in-javascript"><a class="header" href="#arrays-in-javascript">Arrays in JavaScript</a></h2>
<p>An Array is a global object in JavaScript which is used to store multiple values in a single variable. You can create an array in JavaScript by enclosing a comma-separated list of values in square brackets <code>[]</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let fruits = ['Apple', 'Banana', 'Cherry'];
</code></pre>
<p>Arrays in JavaScript can contain any data type, and the data types can be mixed. This includes objects.</p>
<h2 id="objects-in-javascript"><a class="header" href="#objects-in-javascript">Objects in JavaScript</a></h2>
<p>An object in JavaScript is similar to a dictionary in Python. It contains key-value pairs and is denoted by curly braces <code>{}</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let student = {
    name: 'Alice',
    age: 22,
    course: 'Computer Science'
};
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, <code>name</code>, <code>age</code>, and <code>course</code> are the keys, and 'Alice', 22, and 'Computer Science' are their respective values.</p>
<h2 id="arrays-of-objects"><a class="header" href="#arrays-of-objects">Arrays of Objects</a></h2>
<p>An array of objects is simply an array where its elements are objects. Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let students = [
    {
        name: 'Alice',
        age: 22,
        course: 'Computer Science'
    },
    {
        name: 'Bob',
        age: 24,
        course: 'Physics'
    }
];
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>students</code> is an array that contains two objects.</p>
<h2 id="accessing-data-in-arrays-of-objects"><a class="header" href="#accessing-data-in-arrays-of-objects">Accessing Data in Arrays of Objects</a></h2>
<p>You can access data in arrays of objects by specifying the index of the object in the array, followed by the key of the value you want to access. For example, to access Bob's age:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let bobAge = students[1].age; // 24
</code></pre>
<p>This is analogous to accessing elements in a list of dictionaries in Python.</p>
<h2 id="modifying-data-in-arrays-of-objects"><a class="header" href="#modifying-data-in-arrays-of-objects">Modifying Data in Arrays of Objects</a></h2>
<p>You can modify the data in an object within an array by assigning a new value to the specific key:</p>

<p>In your JavaScript learning journey, you've probably seen ES5, ES6, ES2015. It's hard to get lost on all those concepts, so let's explain what they mean:</p>
<p>JavaScript's development has been guided by a series of standards (and improvements) called ECMAScript (ES). Understanding the evolution of these standards can give us a deeper appreciation for the language as it exists today.</p>
<h2 id="es1-1997"><a class="header" href="#es1-1997">ES1 (1997)</a></h2>
<p>ECMAScript 1 was the first version of the standard, released in June 1997, about a year and a half after JavaScript's initial creation. This standard was vital in that it codified JavaScript's syntax and semantics, ensuring that the nascent web would have a single scripting language that worked consistently across different browsers and platforms.</p>
<h2 id="es2-1998"><a class="header" href="#es2-1998">ES2 (1998)</a></h2>
<p>The second edition of ECMAScript was a minor editorial revision to align with an ISO standard for the language. There were no new features or significant changes in ES2 compared to ES1. This standard was published in June 1998.</p>
<h2 id="es3-1999"><a class="header" href="#es3-1999">ES3 (1999)</a></h2>
<p>ES3 brought significant enhancements to the language, including error handling with try/catch, better error definition, and formatted numeric output. It laid much of the foundation for JavaScript as we know it today.</p>
<h2 id="es4-abandoned"><a class="header" href="#es4-abandoned">ES4 (Abandoned)</a></h2>
<p>ES4 was planned as a substantial overhaul of JavaScript with new features and changes. However, disagreements within the ECMAScript community about the language's future direction led to this version being abandoned.</p>
<h2 id="es5-2009"><a class="header" href="#es5-2009">ES5 (2009)</a></h2>
<p>After a ten-year hiatus, ES5 was released with several critical additions:</p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;Strict Mode&quot;: An opt-in mode that tightens the language's rules to catch more errors during development.</li>
<li>Accessor properties: Getters and setters for object properties.</li>
<li>Array methods: New ways to manipulate arrays, such as <code>map</code>, <code>filter</code>, <code>reduce</code>, and <code>forEach</code>.</li>
<li>JSON support: Native parsing and stringifying for JSON data.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="es6--es2015-2015"><a class="header" href="#es6--es2015-2015">ES6 / ES2015 (2015)</a></h2>
<p>This significant update to the language introduced many features that reshaped JavaScript programming:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>let</code> and <code>const</code>: Block-scoped alternatives to <code>var</code>.</li>
<li>Arrow functions: A new function syntax with lexical <code>this</code>.</li>
<li>Classes: A new syntax for creating objects and dealing with inheritance.</li>
<li>.. many more</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="es2016--es7-2016-to-es2021--es12-2021"><a class="header" href="#es2016--es7-2016-to-es2021--es12-2021">ES2016 / ES7 (2016) to ES2021 / ES12 (2021)</a></h2>
<p>Starting with ES2016, the ECMAScript standard moved to an annual release schedule. Each new version includes a set of carefully considered features, steadily improving the language while avoiding the significant disruptions of an overhaul like ES6.</p>
<hr />
<p>JavaScript's evolution is a testament to its vibrant and active developer community. With each new version, the language becomes more powerful, versatile, and enjoyable to work with, ensuring its continued relevance in the world of web development.</p>

<p>Welcome to our exploration of the DOM! Now, as we dive deeper into web development, it's crucial to understand what the DOM is and how we interact with it.</p>
<p>First, we'll discuss the concept of the DOM itself, giving you a clear picture of its role in web pages. Next, we'll delve into the different types of nodes or elements that make up the DOM.</p>
<p>Once we have a foundational understanding, we'll move into more hands-on topics: how to select specific elements, how to update them to display new content or styles, and methods to add or remove elements on the page.</p>
<p>By the end of this section, through exercises and examples, you'll gain practical experience manipulating the DOM and enhancing user interaction on web pages. We'll finish with some questions to consolidate your learning. Get ready for a fun dive into one of the core aspects of web interactivity!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-is-the-dom"><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-dom">What is the DOM?</a></h1>
<p>If you've ever built a web page or used JavaScript to create dynamic, interactive web content, you've likely encountered the Document Object Model (DOM). Understanding the DOM is crucial for anyone looking to harness the full power of JavaScript in their web applications.</p>
<p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents. It represents the structure of a document and enables programming languages to manipulate the content and structure of a web document.</p>
<p>In essence, the DOM transforms your HTML document into an object-oriented tree structure with elements such as <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;header&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, and <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> becoming nodes on the tree. This tree-like structure is often referred to as the &quot;DOM Tree&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="the-structure-of-the-dom"><a class="header" href="#the-structure-of-the-dom">The Structure of the DOM</a></h2>
<p>The DOM represents an HTML or XML document as a logical tree structure, with each element, attribute, and piece of text in the document becoming a node in this tree.</p>
<p><img src="lessons/javascript-review/dom/./what-is-the-dom/untitled.png" alt="Untitled" /></p>
<p>At the top of this tree is the <code>Document</code> node. From here, the structure follows the nesting of the markup, with child nodes stemming from their corresponding parent elements.</p>
<p>For example, the DOM representation of the following HTML code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;My First Web Page&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        &lt;h1&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/h1&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;Welcome to my first web page.&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>would look something like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-ascii">Document
    |
    |- DOCTYPE: html
    |- html
        |
        |- head
        |   |
        |   |- title
        |       |
        |       |- #text: My First Web Page
        |
        |- body
            |
            |- h1
            |   |
            |   |- #text: Hello, World!
            |
            |- p
                |
                |- #text: Welcome to my first web page.

<h2 id="working-with-the-dom"><a class="header" href="#working-with-the-dom">Working with the DOM</a></h2>
<p>Web browsers create the DOM automatically upon loading a web page, and JavaScript (or other scripting languages) can interact with the DOM to dynamically change the document's structure, style, and content.</p>
<p>Some common tasks include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Changing the content of HTML elements:</strong> You can select any HTML element and change its content using JavaScript.</li>
<li><strong>Adding and deleting HTML elements:</strong> You can create new elements, append them to existing elements, or remove existing elements and attributes.</li>
<li><strong>Changing CSS styles:</strong> You can select HTML elements and modify their CSS styles.</li>
<li><strong>Reacting to HTML events:</strong> You can assign functions to event handlers on HTML elements, allowing your JavaScript code to react to user interactions like clicks, mouse movements, keyboard input, and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>For example, to change the text of the first <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element in the document, you could use the following JavaScript code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">document.querySelector('p').textContent = 'New text for the first paragraph.';
</code></pre>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="node-types"><a class="header" href="#node-types">Node Types</a></h1>
<p>When working with the Document Object Model (DOM), you will encounter various types of nodes that make up the structure of a webpage. Each type of node plays a unique role within the DOM and offers different functionality.</p>
<h2 id="common-node-types"><a class="header" href="#common-node-types">Common Node Types</a></h2>
<p>The DOM consists of several types of nodes. The most commonly used ones are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Document Node</strong>: The root node of the HTML document. It represents the entire document and it's typically interacted with using the <code>document</code> object.</li>
<li><strong>Element Nodes</strong>: These are the most commonly used nodes and represent each HTML element on the page, such as <code>&lt;body&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;p&gt;</code>, and so on. Element nodes can have attributes and can contain other element nodes, text nodes, and comments. They can be selected and manipulated using various DOM methods.</li>
<li><strong>Text Nodes</strong>: These nodes contain the actual text content within an element node. Any text you see on a webpage, even the whitespace and line breaks, are stored in text nodes.</li>
<li><strong>Attribute Nodes</strong>: These nodes contain the values of HTML attributes. Attribute nodes are accessed and manipulated via their parent element nodes.</li>
<li><strong>Comment Nodes</strong>: These nodes represent HTML comments (<code>&lt;!-- comment --&gt;</code>) in the document.</li>
</ol>
<p>It's important to note that in the DOM, everything is a node and these nodes are organized in a tree-like structure. This structure enables JavaScript to access and update the content of a webpage.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="selecting-elements"><a class="header" href="#selecting-elements">Selecting Elements</a></h1>
<p>Interacting with HTML elements is a crucial part of working with JavaScript and the Document Object Model (DOM). There are several methods available to select HTML elements, allowing you to manipulate their content, style, attributes, and more.</p>
<h2 id="selecting-elements-by-id"><a class="header" href="#selecting-elements-by-id">Selecting Elements by ID</a></h2>
<p>Each HTML element can have a unique ID, and this ID can be used to select a specific element. The <code>document.getElementById()</code> method is used to select an element by its ID.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let element = document.getElementById('myId');
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the element with the ID 'myId' is selected and stored in the variable <code>element</code>.</p>
<h2 id="selecting-elements-by-class-name"><a class="header" href="#selecting-elements-by-class-name">Selecting Elements by Class Name</a></h2>
<p>HTML elements can also share a class name, which can be used to select multiple elements at once. The <code>document.getElementsByClassName()</code> method returns a live HTMLCollection of elements with the given class name.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let elements = document.getElementsByClassName('myClass');
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, all elements with the class 'myClass' are selected. You can then loop through <code>elements</code> to work with each element.</p>
<h2 id="selecting-elements-by-tag-name"><a class="header" href="#selecting-elements-by-tag-name">Selecting Elements by Tag Name</a></h2>
<p>You can also select elements based on their tag name using the <code>document.getElementsByTagName()</code> method. This method also returns a live HTMLCollection of elements.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let elements = document.getElementsByTagName('p');
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, all <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> elements are selected.</p>
<h2 id="query-selectors"><a class="header" href="#query-selectors">Query Selectors</a></h2>
<p>Query selectors offer a more flexible approach to selecting elements. The <code>document.querySelector()</code> method returns the first element that matches a specified CSS selector(s) in the document.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let element = document.querySelector('.myClass');
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the first element with the class 'myClass' is selected.</p>
<p>If you want to select all elements that match a certain CSS selector(s), you can use the <code>document.querySelectorAll()</code> method. This method returns a static <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom_nodelist.asp">NodeList</a> (it's like an array but not officially an array) representing all elements that match the specified group of selectors.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let elements = document.querySelectorAll('.myClass');

</code></pre>
<p>In this example, all elements with the class 'myClass' are selected.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="updating-elements"><a class="header" href="#updating-elements">Updating Elements</a></h1>
<p>One of the key advantages of the Document Object Model (DOM) is the ability to modify HTML elements on a webpage using JavaScript. This allows us to make web pages interactive and dynamic. In this article, we'll explore several ways to update and modify DOM elements.</p>
<h2 id="changing-element-content"><a class="header" href="#changing-element-content">Changing Element Content</a></h2>
<p>To change the text content of an HTML element, you can use the <code>textContent</code> property. This will change the content of the selected element and all its descendants.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let element = document.querySelector('p');
element.textContent = 'New paragraph text.';
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the first <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element on the page is selected, and its text content is changed.</p>
<h2 id="updating-attributes"><a class="header" href="#updating-attributes">Updating Attributes</a></h2>
<p>HTML elements often have attributes, like <code>class</code>, <code>id</code>, <code>href</code>, and <code>src</code>, that can be updated. Use the <code>setAttribute()</code> method to change the value of an attribute:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let link = document.querySelector('a');
link.setAttribute('href', '&lt;https://www.new-url.com&gt;');
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the first <code>&lt;a&gt;</code> element on the page is selected, and its <code>href</code> attribute is changed to <code>'&lt;https://www.new-url.com&gt;'</code>.</p>
<h2 id="adding-and-removing-classes"><a class="header" href="#adding-and-removing-classes">Adding and Removing Classes</a></h2>
<p>To add or remove classes from an element, you can use the <code>classList</code> property, which provides methods like <code>add()</code>, <code>remove()</code>, and <code>toggle()</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let element = document.querySelector('div');
element.classList.add('new-class'); // adds 'new-class' to the element

element.classList.remove('old-class'); // removes 'old-class' from the element

element.classList.toggle('another-class'); // toggles 'another-class'

</code></pre>
<h2 id="changing-css-styles"><a class="header" href="#changing-css-styles">Changing CSS Styles</a></h2>
<p>You can also change the CSS styles of an element using the <code>style</code> property:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let element = document.querySelector('div');
element.style.color = 'blue';
element.style.backgroundColor = 'yellow';
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the first <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element on the page is selected, and its text color and background color are changed.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="inserting-elements"><a class="header" href="#inserting-elements">Inserting Elements</a></h1>
<p>Creating new HTML elements dynamically is a key part of building interactive web applications. The Document Object Model (DOM) provides methods that allow you to create, insert, and manipulate HTML elements on a webpage using JavaScript. Let's explore how to create new elements and add them to your webpage.</p>
<h2 id="creating-new-elements"><a class="header" href="#creating-new-elements">Creating New Elements</a></h2>
<p>The <code>document.createElement()</code> method is used to create a new element. You pass in the tag name of the element you want to create as an argument.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let newDiv = document.createElement('div');
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, a new <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element is created and stored in the variable <code>newDiv</code>. At this point, the new element exists in memory, but <strong>it's not</strong> yet added to the DOM.</p>
<h2 id="adding-text-and-attributes-to-elements"><a class="header" href="#adding-text-and-attributes-to-elements">Adding Text and Attributes to Elements</a></h2>
<p>Before adding the new element to the DOM, you might want to add text content, attributes, or even other elements to it.</p>
<p>To add text content, use the <code>textContent</code> property:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">newDiv.textContent = 'Hello, World!';
</code></pre>
<p>To add attributes, use the <code>setAttribute()</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">newDiv.setAttribute('class', 'myClass');
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, a class named 'myClass' is added to the new <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element.</p>
<h2 id="appending-elements-to-the-dom"><a class="header" href="#appending-elements-to-the-dom">Appending Elements to the DOM</a></h2>
<p>Once you've created a new element and added content or attributes to it, you can then add it to the DOM. The <code>appendChild()</code> method is used to add a new child node to an existing element.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">document.body.appendChild(newDiv);
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the new <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element is added to the body of the webpage as a child node.</p>
<h2 id="inserting-elements-at-specific-positions"><a class="header" href="#inserting-elements-at-specific-positions">Inserting Elements at Specific Positions</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes, you may want to insert a new element at a specific position in the DOM, not just at the end. In such cases, you can use the <code>insertBefore()</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let parent = document.querySelector('div');
let child = parent.firstChild;
let newElement = document.createElement('p');
newElement.textContent = 'New paragraph';

parent.insertBefore(newElement, child);
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, a new <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> element is created and inserted as the first child of a <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> element, before the existing first child.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="deleting-elements"><a class="header" href="#deleting-elements">Deleting Elements</a></h1>
<p>You may find the need to remove elements from the Document Object Model (DOM). Whether it's because a user action triggers the removal or it's part of your application's state changes, knowing how to properly remove elements is helpful, so let's explore:</p>
<h2 id="removing-a-specific-element"><a class="header" href="#removing-a-specific-element">Removing a Specific Element</a></h2>
<p>To remove a specific element, you can use the <code>remove()</code> method. This method removes the element on which it's called:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let elementToRemove = document.querySelector('.remove-me');
elementToRemove.remove();
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the element with the class 'remove-me' is selected and then removed from the DOM.</p>
<h2 id="removing-child-elements"><a class="header" href="#removing-child-elements">Removing Child Elements</a></h2>
<p>If you want to remove a child element from a specific parent element, you can use the <code>removeChild()</code> method:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let parentElement = document.querySelector('.parent');
let childElement = document.querySelector('.child');
parentElement.removeChild(childElement);
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the element with the class 'child' is removed from the parent element with the class 'parent'.</p>
<p>It's important to note that <code>removeChild()</code> is called on the parent node, not on the child node you want to remove.</p>
<h2 id="clearing-all-child-elements"><a class="header" href="#clearing-all-child-elements">Clearing All Child Elements</a></h2>
<p>Sometimes, you might want to remove all child elements of a given parent element. You can do this by looping over the child elements and removing them one by one:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let parentElement = document.querySelector('.parent');

while (parentElement.firstChild) {
    parentElement.removeChild(parentElement.firstChild);
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, all child elements of the element with the class 'parent' are removed. The <code>while</code> loop continues as long as <code>parentElement</code> has a <code>firstChild</code>, ensuring all child nodes are removed.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="events"><a class="header" href="#events">Events</a></h1>
<p>Let's switch gears and dive into another vital aspect of web development: browser events. Events are the bread and butter of interactivity on the web. They allow users to interact with web pages through actions like clicking, typing, dragging, and many more.</p>
<p>In this section, we'll kick things off by understanding what an event is in the context of web development. Then, we'll explore the variety of events available to us--believe me, there's an event for almost everything!</p>
<p>Additionally, when an event occurs, there's often a lot of information associated with it. We'll learn how to access and utilize this information.</p>
<p>By the end of this module, you'll be well-equipped to make your web pages come alive with user interactions. Let's dive in!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-is-an-event"><a class="header" href="#what-is-an-event">What is an Event</a></h1>
<p>In the context of web development, interaction, and responsiveness are key elements of a compelling user experience. JavaScript events form the backbone of this interactive web by enabling your application to respond to user actions in real-time. This article explains why JavaScript events are crucial in web development and provides a few basic examples to illustrate their usage.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="making-websites-interactive"><a class="header" href="#making-websites-interactive">Making Websites Interactive</a></h2>
<p>Without JavaScript events, websites would be static and unresponsive to user input. Events allow us to add interactivity to our sites, enhancing the user experience. When a user clicks a button, submits a form, moves the mouse, or even presses a key, an event is fired. By listening for these events, we can execute JavaScript code in response to user actions, making our websites interactive and responsive.</p>
<p>For example, let's create a simple event listener for a button-click event that displays &quot;Hello, World!&quot; in the console:</p>
<p>HTML:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;button id=&quot;myButton&quot;&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">document.getElementById('myButton').addEventListener('click', function() {
    console.log('Hello, World!');
});
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, when the button is clicked, the anonymous function passed to <code>addEventListener</code> (JavaScript method to define events). is executed and &quot;Hello, World!&quot; is logged to the console.</p>
<h2 id="user-feedback"><a class="header" href="#user-feedback">User Feedback</a></h2>
<p>Events provide immediate feedback to the user. For instance, when a user clicks a button to submit a form, an event listener can be set up to validate the form fields. If the validation fails, the event handler can display an error message. This immediate feedback improves the user experience by making the website more intuitive and user-friendly.</p>
<p>For example, suppose we want to validate a text input field and provide immediate feedback upon form submission:</p>
<p>HTML:</p>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;form id=&quot;myForm&quot;&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;name&quot; placeholder=&quot;Enter your name&quot; required&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Submit&quot;&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;p id=&quot;message&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>JavaScript:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">document.getElementById('myForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault(); // prevent form submission
    let name = document.getElementById('name').value;
    if(name === '') {
        document.getElementById('message').textContent = 'Name is required!';
    } else {
        document.getElementById('message').textContent = `Hello, ${name}!`;
    }
});
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, if the user tries to submit the form without entering a name, the message &quot;Name is required!&quot; is displayed. If a name is provided, a personalized greeting is displayed.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="types-of-events"><a class="header" href="#types-of-events">Types of Events</a></h1>
<p>As we covered before, JavaScript is known for its capability to create interactive and dynamic web applications. This dynamism largely depends on the events JavaScript can listen for and respond to. Events are actions or occurrences that happen in the browser. JavaScript provides a plethora of event types that cater to a myriad of user interactions. This article will discuss several common event types.</p>
<h2 id="mouse-events"><a class="header" href="#mouse-events">Mouse Events</a></h2>
<p>Mouse events are triggered by user interactions with a mouse or similar input device.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>click</code>: Fired when the user clicks an element.</li>
<li><code>dblclick</code>: Fired when the user double-clicks an element.</li>
<li><code>mousemove</code>: Fired when the mouse pointer is moved within an element.</li>
<li><code>mousedown</code> and <code>mouseup</code>: Fired when a mouse button is pressed and then released.</li>
<li><code>mouseover</code> and <code>mouseout</code>: Fired when the mouse pointer enters and leaves an element.</li>
<li><code>mouseenter</code> and <code>mouseleave</code>: Similar to <code>mouseover</code> and <code>mouseout</code>, but do not bubble and are not triggered when the mouse pointer hovers over a child element.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="keyboard-events"><a class="header" href="#keyboard-events">Keyboard Events</a></h2>
<p>Keyboard events are triggered by user interactions with the keyboard.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>keydown</code>: Fired when a key is pressed down.</li>
<li><code>keyup</code>: Fired when a key is released.</li>
<li><code>keypress</code>: Fired when a key that produces a character value is pressed down.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="form-events"><a class="header" href="#form-events">Form Events</a></h2>
<p>Form events are triggered by user interactions with form elements.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>submit</code>: Fired when a form is submitted.</li>
<li><code>change</code>: Fired when the value of an element has been changed.</li>
<li><code>input</code>: Fired when the user inputs data into an <code>&lt;input&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;textarea&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;select&gt;</code> element.</li>
<li><code>focus</code>: Fired when an element gets focus.</li>
<li><code>blur</code>: Fired when an element loses focus.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="window-events"><a class="header" href="#window-events">Window Events</a></h2>
<p>Window events are triggered by the browser window.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>load</code>: Fired when the entire page has loaded.</li>
<li><code>resize</code>: Fired when the browser window is resized.</li>
<li><code>scroll</code>: Fired when the user scrolls the page.</li>
<li><code>unload</code>: Fired once a page has unloaded (or the browser window has been closed).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="other-events"><a class="header" href="#other-events">Other Events</a></h2>
<p>There are many more events available. For instance, touch events (<code>touchstart</code>, <code>touchmove</code>, <code>touchend</code>, etc.) are essential for mobile web development. Drag and drop events (<code>dragstart</code>, <code>drag</code>, <code>drop</code>, etc.) enable drag-and-drop functionality. Media events (<code>play</code>, <code>pause</code>, <code>ended</code>, etc.) are used to control audio and video.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="accessing-the-event-information"><a class="header" href="#accessing-the-event-information">Accessing the Event Information</a></h1>
<hr />
<p>In JavaScript, when an event is triggered, it creates an <code>Event</code> object that contains information related to that event. This object is automatically passed as the first argument to your event handler function, typically represented by <code>event</code> or <code>e</code>.</p>
<h2 id="the-event-object"><a class="header" href="#the-event-object">The Event Object</a></h2>
<p>The <code>Event</code> object comes with a variety of properties and methods that provide information about the event. Let's see some of them:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>event.type</code>: The <code>type</code> property contains a string that identifies the type of the event, such as 'click', 'submit', 'keydown', etc.</li>
<li><code>event.target</code>: The <code>target</code> property refers to the element that triggered the event.</li>
<li><code>event.currentTarget</code>: The <code>currentTarget</code> property refers to the element that the event listener was attached to.</li>
</ul>
<p>These properties can provide valuable information about the event and the context in which it was triggered. Consider the following example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('click', function(event) {
    console.log('Event type: ' + event.type); // Outputs: 'click'
    console.log('Event target: ' + event.target.tagName); // Outputs: 'BUTTON'
});

</code></pre>
<h2 id="accessing-mouse-event-information"><a class="header" href="#accessing-mouse-event-information">Accessing Mouse Event Information</a></h2>
<p>When handling mouse events, the <code>MouseEvent</code> object, which extends from the <code>Event</code> object, provides additional properties:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>event.clientX</code> and <code>event.clientY</code>: The <code>clientX</code> and <code>clientY</code> properties provide the horizontal and vertical coordinates, respectively, of the mouse when the event was triggered, relative to the client area of the window.</li>
<li><code>event.pageX</code> and <code>event.pageY</code>: Similarly, <code>pageX</code> and <code>pageY</code> provide the coordinates of the mouse relative to the whole document.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example of accessing mouse event information:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">document.querySelector('button').addEventListener('mousemove', 
    function(event) {
    console.log(
            'Mouse position (X, Y): ' + event.clientX + ', ' + event.clientY
        );
});
</code></pre>
<h2 id="accessing-keyboard-event-information"><a class="header" href="#accessing-keyboard-event-information">Accessing Keyboard Event Information</a></h2>
<p>In keyboard events, the <code>KeyboardEvent</code> object, another extension of the <code>Event</code> object, provides properties like:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>event.key</code>: The <code>key</code> property represents the value of the key pressed by the user.</li>
<li><code>event.keyCode</code>: The <code>keyCode</code> property represents the Unicode of the key pressed by the user (Note: this property is deprecated and should be avoided).</li>
<li><code>event.code</code>: The <code>code</code> property represents a string that identifies the physical key pressed by the user.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">document.querySelector('input').addEventListener('keydown', function(event) {
    console.log('Key pressed: ' + event.key);
    console.log('Key code: ' + event.code);
});
</code></pre>
<h2 id="event-methods"><a class="header" href="#event-methods">Event Methods</a></h2>
<p>The <code>Event</code> object also includes methods to control the default behavior of the event:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>event.preventDefault()</code>: The <code>preventDefault</code> method stops the browser from performing the default action of the event. For instance, it can prevent a form from being submitted.</li>
<li><code>event.stopPropagation()</code>: The <code>stopPropagation</code> method prevents the event from bubbling up the DOM tree, stopping any parent handlers from being notified of the event.</li>
</ul>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">document.querySelector('form').addEventListener('submit', function(event) {
    event.preventDefault(); // Stops form from submitting
    // Code to handle form data
});
</code></pre>

<p>Something that always helps to &quot;make it more tangible&quot; you can draw a prototype <strong>of the entire project on paper and pencil</strong>. </p>
<p>Drawing is a quick process that allows you to understand how, when, and where things happen; Where exactly should such and such a thing say, what happens if the user does A or B, where should they click, what information exactly do you want to show them, etc. <strong>Devote a maximum of two hours to this before you start coding.</strong></p>

<p>Don't spend hours discussing the theme of the <em>trivia</em> or making logos with the feeling that you are &quot;moving forward&quot;. It is natural that you have the impulse to do so, it is your brain asking for its dose of <strong>immediate satisfaction</strong>. Do not be fooled by the &quot;illusion&quot; of progress, <strong>your goal is to learn</strong>. Face what you do not know as soon as possible, it is the only way to achieve it.</p>

Next, we will delve into one of the essential parts of software development: testing. We will learn about writing unit tests, which are a type of testing that ensures individual pieces of your code are functioning as expected. Lastly, we will learn how to deploy our applications using GitHub Pages, a free platform to host your web apps directly from your GitHub repository.</p>
<p>By the end of this module, you'll have a deeper understanding of how to write, test, and deploy professional-level JavaScript code. All these skills will come together in the final project of this module.</p>

<p>In this article, we will learn JavaScript Modules. Modules are particularly useful for maintaining a clean and organized codebase and can dramatically improve code reuse, comprehension, and maintenance.</p>
<p>You can think of modules as just JavaScript in separate files. So instead of writing your code in one single file, you will split it (while still being able to re-use each function across different files).</p>
<p><img src="lessons/development-best-practices/./javascript-modules/untitled.png" alt="Untitled" /></p>
<h2 id="why-use-javascript-modules"><a class="header" href="#why-use-javascript-modules">Why Use JavaScript Modules?</a></h2>
<p>JavaScript modules help you manage and organize your code better. They allow you to split your code into smaller, reusable components that you can import wherever you need them. This approach makes it easier to develop, maintain, and understand complex applications.</p>
<p>When you use JavaScript modules, each module has its own scope. This means that variables, functions, and classes declared in a module are not accessible outside of that module <strong>unless they are explicitly exported</strong>. This helps prevent naming collisions between different parts of your application.</p>
<h2 id="the-importance-of-bundling"><a class="header" href="#the-importance-of-bundling">The Importance of Bundling</a></h2>
<p>Bundling is the process of taking multiple JavaScript files and combining them into one file for the browser to download. Bundling is beneficial for a couple of reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Performance</strong>: Instead of making multiple requests for many different files, the browser only needs to make a single request for one bundled file.</li>
<li><strong>Compatibility</strong>: Bundlers often come with built-in support for JavaScript features that are not universally supported by all browsers. The bundler can convert your code into a version of JavaScript that's compatible with most browsers.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are several popular bundlers available such as <a href="https://webpack.js.org/">Webpack</a>, <a href="https://browserify.org/">Browserify</a>, but for this article, we'll use <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite.js</a> due to its speed and simplicity.</p>
<p><img src="lessons/development-best-practices/./javascript-modules/untitled-1.png" alt="Untitled" /></p>
<h2 id="an-introduction-to-vitejs"><a class="header" href="#an-introduction-to-vitejs">An Introduction to Vite.js</a></h2>
<p>Let's see how we can use Vite.js in a simple project. First, you need to install Vite.js. You can do this by running the following command in your terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm init @vitejs/app
</code></pre>
<p>This will create a new Vite project. After you've installed Vite and created a project, you can start writing modular JavaScript, HTML, CSS code.</p>
<p>In a typical Vite.js application, you'd have a basic project structure similar to this:</p>
<pre><code>/my-vite-project
|-- /src
|   |-- main.js
|   |-- math.js
|   |-- style.css
|-- index.html
|-- package.json
|-- vite.config.js
</code></pre>
<p>Vite's speed and ease of use make it an excellent choice for modern web development, whether you're working with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, or a combination of all three.</p>
<p>Here is an example:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create a file called <code>math.js</code></strong>:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

module.exports = add;
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create a file called <code>geometry.js</code></strong>:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function calculateArea(radius) {
    return Math.PI * radius * radius;
}

module.exports = { calculateArea };
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li><strong>Import these functions in <code>main.js</code></strong>:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import './style.css';
import add from './math.js';
import { calculateArea } from './geometry.js';

let radius = 5;
console.log(add(2, 3));                        // 5
console.log(calculateArea(radius));            // 78.53981633974483

// You can also add event listeners here

document.querySelector(&quot;#calculate-button&quot;).addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, ()=&gt;{
    const radius = document.querySelector('#radius-input').value
    const area = calculateArea(radius)
    document.querySelector('area-output').innerHTML = area;
})
</code></pre>
<ol>
<li><strong>Include HTML and CSS files</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!-- index.html --&gt;
&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html

 lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
    &lt;meta charset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;&gt;
    &lt;meta name=&quot;viewport&quot; content=&quot;width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Vite App&lt;/title&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
    &lt;div id=&quot;app&quot;&gt;
        &lt;input type=&quot;number&quot; id=&quot;radius-input&quot; placeholder=&quot;Enter radius&quot;&gt;
        &lt;button id=&quot;calculate-button&quot;&gt;Calculate&lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;p id=&quot;area-output&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;script type=&quot;module&quot; src=&quot;main.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;

</code></pre>
<h3 id="exports-and-imports"><a class="header" href="#exports-and-imports">Exports and imports</a></h3>
<p><code>module.exports</code> is the object that's returned as the result of a <code>require</code> call. Whatever you assign to <code>module.exports</code> will be exposed as the public API of your module.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">// math.js
function add(a, b) {
    return a + b;
}

function subtract(a, b) {
    return a - b;
}

module.exports = { add, subtract };

</code></pre>
<p>This way, the <code>add</code> and <code>subtract</code> functions are now part of the <code>module.exports</code> object, and they will be available to any other file that <code>requires</code> the <code>math.js</code> module:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">// main.js
const math = require('./math.js');

console.log(math.add(2, 3));      // 5
console.log(math.subtract(5, 3)); // 2

</code></pre>
<p>It's important to note that this system of <code>require</code> and <code>module.exports</code> is not native to JavaScript itself, but was implemented in Node.js as a way to manage modules and dependencies. It was the standard way to work with modules in Node.js until ES6 introduced <code>import</code> and <code>export</code> syntax. However, it is still widely used.</p>
<p>Please note that <code>require</code> and <code>module.exports</code> don't work natively in the browser. They are specific to the Node.js environment, and if you're working in a browser environment, you'll likely be using a tool like Vite.js, Webpack, or Browserify, which have built-in support for handling this syntax and making it compatible with the browser.</p>
<p>When you're ready to build your project for production, Vite.js will bundle your JavaScript and CSS together and handle any necessary transformations to ensure browser compatibility.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="deploying-to-github-pages"><a class="header" href="#deploying-to-github-pages">Deploying to GitHub Pages</a></h1>
<p>While developing your applications, it's crucial to have a reliable and accessible way to share your projects with the world. For static sites (composed of HTML, CSS, and JS), one great option is GitHub Pages.</p>
<p>This article will guide you through the process of deploying your static website to GitHub Pages.</p>
<h2 id="step-1-create-a-github-repository"><a class="header" href="#step-1-create-a-github-repository">Step 1: Create a GitHub Repository</a></h2>
<p>First, you'll need a GitHub repository to host your website's files. If you haven't done so already, create a new repository on GitHub. You can name it anything you like, but keep in mind that the repository name will be in the URL of your hosted site.</p>
<h2 id="step-2-upload-your-websites-files"><a class="header" href="#step-2-upload-your-websites-files">Step 2: Upload Your Website's Files</a></h2>
<p>Once you have a repository, upload your website's files to it. You can do this by either cloning the repository to your local machine and pushing the files or by uploading the files directly on GitHub. Your repository should now contain at least one HTML file (usually <code>index.html</code>), along with any CSS and JavaScript files your website requires.</p>
<h2 id="step-3-configure-github-pages"><a class="header" href="#step-3-configure-github-pages">Step 3: Configure GitHub Pages</a></h2>
<p>Now, it's time to set up GitHub Pages for your repository:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your repository on GitHub.</li>
<li>Click on the &quot;Settings&quot; tab.</li>
<li>Scroll down to the <strong>&quot;Pages&quot;</strong> section.</li>
<li>In the &quot;Source&quot; dropdown, select the branch that contains your website's files. This is usually the <code>master</code> or <code>main</code> branch.</li>
<li>Click &quot;Save.&quot;</li>
</ol>
<p>GitHub will now publish your website and display a link to it in the GitHub Pages section.</p>
<p><img src="lessons/development-best-practices/./gh-pages-deploy/screenshot-2023-05-26-at-12.04.10.png" alt="Screenshot 2023-05-26 at 12.04.10.png" /></p>
<h2 id="step-4-access-your-website"><a class="header" href="#step-4-access-your-website">Step 4: Access Your Website</a></h2>
<p>Your website is now live! Click on the link provided in the GitHub Pages section of your repository's settings. It should look something like <code>https://&lt;your-username&gt;.github.io/&lt;repository-name&gt;/</code>.</p>
<p>You can share this link with anyone you want to access your website. Any changes you push to the selected branch will automatically be reflected on the live site.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="writing-unit-tests"><a class="header" href="#writing-unit-tests">Writing Unit Tests</a></h1>
<p>While creating our applications, testing is a critical aspect that ensures the correctness and reliability of your code. Testing, particularly unit testing, is all about writing additional code to verify if your functions are working as expected. One of the most popular testing libraries in the JavaScript ecosystem is <a href="https://jestjs.io/">Jest</a>. This article will guide you through the process of writing a basic unit test with Jest.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-to-test-functions"><a class="header" href="#why-do-we-need-to-test-functions">Why Do We Need to Test Functions?</a></h2>
<p>Unit tests allow developers to test individual units of code (usually functions) in isolation. If a unit test passes, you can be confident that the function is correctly doing what it was designed to do. This makes the codebase more robust and less prone to bugs.</p>
<p>Tests also serve as documentation. By reading the tests, other developers can understand what a function is supposed to do and what its output should be for a given input. Additionally, tests make refactoring safer and easier because you'll quickly find out if your changes have broken anything.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-jest"><a class="header" href="#setting-up-jest">Setting Up Jest</a></h2>
<p>Before you can write tests with Jest, you'll need to install it. Create a new project with NPM and then in install Jest  (from the root folder) You can do this using npm (Node Package Manager) in your terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm install --save-dev jest
</code></pre>
<p>This command installs Jest as a devDependency, meaning it will not be included when your code is compiled for production.</p>
<h2 id="writing-your-first-test-with-jest"><a class="header" href="#writing-your-first-test-with-jest">Writing Your First Test with Jest</a></h2>
<p>Now that you have Jest installed, let's write a &quot;Hello, World!&quot; test.</p>
<p>First, create a new JavaScript file for your function. Let's call it <code>greeting.js</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function greeting() {
    return &quot;Hello, World!&quot;;
}

module.exports = greeting;
</code></pre>
<p>Next, create another JavaScript file for your test. By convention, it should be named after the file it's testing with <code>.test.</code> added before the file extension. So, let's call it <code>greeting.test.js</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">const greeting = require('./greeting');

test('the function greeting should return &quot;Hello, World!&quot;', () =&gt; {
    expect(greeting()).toBe(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
});
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>test</code> function takes two arguments: a string description of the test and a callback function to run the test. Inside the callback function, we use <code>expect</code> to assert what the result should be. The <code>toBe</code> method checks that the output of <code>greeting()</code> is exactly <code>&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</code>.</p>
<h2 id="running-the-test"><a class="header" href="#running-the-test">Running the Test</a></h2>
<p>To run your test, you'll use the <code>jest</code> command in your terminal:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npx jest
</code></pre>
<p>If everything is set up correctly, Jest will find and run your test, then report back whether it passed or failed.</p>
<hr />
<p>In addition to the <code>test</code> function, Jest provides <code>describe</code> and <code>it</code> functions to help structure your tests in a more readable and organized manner. They allow you to group tests and create more descriptive test names, making your tests function both as checks for code correctness and as effective documentation.</p>
<h3 id="why-use-describe-and-it"><a class="header" href="#why-use-describe-and-it">Why Use <code>describe</code> and <code>it</code>?</a></h3>
<p>The <code>describe</code> function allows you to group related tests together, often those tests which target the same function or a specific feature of your application. This helps to keep your test suite organized, making it easier for other developers (and you, in the future) to understand the purpose and coverage of your tests.</p>
<p>The <code>it</code> function is equivalent to <code>test</code>. It's simply an alias that, when combined with <code>describe</code>, can lead to more readable test output.</p>
<p>By using <code>describe</code> and <code>it</code>, you can write your tests in a way that they read almost like sentences, describing the behavior of your functions in clear terms.</p>
<h2 id="example-testing-greeting-function-with-describe-and-it"><a class="header" href="#example-testing-greeting-function-with-describe-and-it">Example: Testing <code>greeting</code> Function with <code>describe</code> and <code>it</code></a></h2>
<p>Let's rework our previous <code>greeting</code> function tests using <code>describe</code> and <code>it</code>. Suppose we want to test not just the basic functionality, but also how <code>greeting</code> behaves when given an argument.</p>
<p>First, update your <code>greeting.js</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function greeting(name) {
    if (name) {
        return `Hello, ${name}!`;
    }
    return &quot;Hello, World!&quot;;
}

module.exports = greeting;

</code></pre>
<p>The function now takes an optional <code>name</code> parameter. If <code>name</code> is provided, it will greet the named individual; otherwise, it will default to <code>&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</code>.</p>
<p>Next, rewrite the tests in <code>greeting.test.js</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">const greeting = require('./greeting');

describe('greeting', () =&gt; {
    it('returns &quot;Hello, World!&quot; when called without arguments', () =&gt; {
        expect(greeting()).toBe(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
    });

    it('greets the provided name when called with a string argument', () =&gt; {
        expect(greeting(&quot;Jest&quot;)).toBe(&quot;Hello, Jest!&quot;);
    });
});

</code></pre>
<p>In the test file, we now have a <code>describe</code> block for <code>greeting</code> that groups two tests together. The <code>it</code> function is used instead of <code>test</code>, and the combination of <code>describe</code> and <code>it</code> leads to more readable test names.</p>
<p>You also might be curious about what <code>describe</code> and <code>it</code> individually do. They basically provide formatting to  the test. Try to write a test with only <code>describe</code> (without <code>it</code>) or vice versa and you will see how different the format in the console is!</p>

<p>Encryption means: <em>hide the content of a message from plain sight, so that only authorized parties can decipher an encrypted text</em>. The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher">Caesar Cipher</a> is one of the earliest known encryption methods. The Roman emperor Julius Caesar used it to send secret orders to his generals on the battlefield.</p>
<p>The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest techniques for encrypting a message, each letter of the original text is replaced by another letter found a fixed number of positions (offset) ahead in the same alphabet.</p>
<p><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Caesar3.svg/2000px-Caesar3.svg.png" alt="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/2b/Caesar3.svg/2000px-Caesar3.svg.png" /></p>
<p>For example, if we use an offset of <strong>3</strong> positions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The letter A is encrypted as D.</li>
<li>The word CASA is encrypted as FDVD.</li>
<li>Unencrypted alphabet: A B C D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z</li>
<li>Encrypted alphabet: D E F G H I J K L M N O P Q R S T U V W X Y Z A B C</li>
</ul>
<p>Today, all simple substitution ciphers are easily decrypted and, although they do not offer much security, but for our learning, it's perfect!</p>
<h2 id="2-project-summary-1"><a class="header" href="#2-project-summary-1">2. Project Summary</a></h2>
<p>In this project, you will create a web application that will allow a user to encrypt and decrypt a text in the browser by indicating a specific character shift (offset).</p>
<p>You will use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>You should have an text input that allows the user to input a message and set a numerical offset, then print the encrypted message somewhere in the screen.</p>
<p>The design of the app (colors, box location placement, etc) are done at your own discretion.</p>
<p>You will need to write uni tests for your modules to test that you encryption algorithm is working in all cases.</p>

<p><strong>Welcome to Week 3: Advanced JavaScript!</strong></p>
<p>In this week, we will dive into some of the more advanced features of JavaScript, especially focusing on methods for working with arrays. These methods are incredibly powerful and allow us to write more expressive, efficient, and readable code. We'll also get hands-on with CSS Flexbox, a modern layout model that makes it easy to design flexible and responsive layouts.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="advanced-array-methods-1"><a class="header" href="#advanced-array-methods-1">Advanced Array Methods 1</a></h1>
<p>As you may already know from your Python experience, arrays (or lists in Python) are a fundamental aspect of any programming language, and JavaScript is no exception. JavaScript has built-in array methods that can be used to manipulate and work with data effectively.</p>
<p>In this first section, we'll delve into the essential methods: <code>forEach()</code>, <code>map()</code>, <code>filter()</code>, <code>reduce()</code>, and <code>sort()</code>.</p>
<h2 id="1-foreach"><a class="header" href="#1-foreach">1. forEach()</a></h2>
<p>In Python, you might use a for loop to iterate over a list. JavaScript provides a similar function known as <code>forEach()</code>. The <code>forEach()</code> method calls a function once for each element in an array, in order.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
numbers.forEach(num =&gt; console.log(num));
</code></pre>
<p>This will log each number in the console.</p>
<h2 id="2-map"><a class="header" href="#2-map">2. map()</a></h2>
<p>Like Python's list comprehension, JavaScript's <code>map()</code> function allows you to apply a function to every item in an array and return a new array with the results.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let squared = numbers.map(num =&gt; num * num);
console.log(squared); // prints: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
</code></pre>
<p>Here we've created a new array of the squares of each number.</p>
<h2 id="3-filter"><a class="header" href="#3-filter">3. filter()</a></h2>
<p>The <code>filter()</code> function creates a new array with all elements that pass a specified condition.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let evens = numbers.filter(num =&gt; num % 2 === 0);
console.log(evens); // prints: [2, 4]
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, we have filtered the original array to create a new array that only includes the even numbers.</p>
<h2 id="4-reduce"><a class="header" href="#4-reduce">4. reduce()</a></h2>
<p>The <code>reduce()</code> method applies a function against an accumulator and each element in the array (from left to right) to reduce it to a single value. It's somewhat similar to the <code>sum()</code> function in Python, but it's more powerful as it can be used with any binary function.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let sum = numbers.reduce((total, num) =&gt; total + num, 0);
console.log(sum); // prints: 15
</code></pre>
<p>We've just computed the sum of the array. The second argument <code>0</code> is the initial value of the <code>total</code>.</p>
<h2 id="5-sort"><a class="header" href="#5-sort">5. sort()</a></h2>
<p>The <code>sort()</code> method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the array. The default sort order is <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45950646/what-is-lexicographical-order">lexicographical</a> (not numeric), but a compare function can be provided.</p>
<pre><code>let numbers = [1, 10, 2, 21, 3];
numbers.sort((a, b) =&gt; a - b);
console.log(numbers); // prints: [1, 2, 3, 10, 21]

</code></pre>
<p>In this case, we have sorted the numbers in ascending order. The compare function <code>(a, b) =&gt; a - b</code> is needed to sort the numbers correctly. Without it, JavaScript would convert numbers to strings and then sort lexicographically, which could give unexpected results.</p>
<p>In summary, JavaScript provides several built-in array methods that can be used for manipulating and working with arrays. If you're coming from Python, many of these methods should feel familiar, but with a JavaScript twist. Next, we'll explore some of the more advanced array methods, so stay tuned!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="advanced-array-methods-2"><a class="header" href="#advanced-array-methods-2">Advanced Array Methods 2</a></h1>
<p>This time, we will be looking at <code>some()</code>, <code>every()</code>, <code>find()</code>, <code>findIndex()</code>, and <code>includes()</code>.</p>
<p>Before we start, let's discuss an important concept in JavaScript that's used in all of these methods - the callback function.</p>
<h2 id="callback-functions-1"><a class="header" href="#callback-functions-1">Callback Functions</a></h2>
<p>A callback function is a function passed into another function as an argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. In other words, when we use methods like <code>map()</code>, <code>filter()</code>, <code>find()</code>, etc., the function that we are passing in is a callback function. It's &quot;called back&quot; by the method at some point.</p>
<p>Now, let's move on to the array methods.</p>
<h2 id="1-some"><a class="header" href="#1-some">1. some()</a></h2>
<p>The <code>some()</code> method checks if at least one element in the array passes the test implemented by the provided function. It's somewhat similar to the <code>any()</code> function in Python.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let hasNegativeNumbers = numbers.some(num =&gt; num &lt; 0);
console.log(hasNegativeNumbers); // prints: false

</code></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>num =&gt; num &lt; 0</code> is our callback function. It uses <a href="https://domhabersack.com/implicit-return">implicit return</a>, a JavaScript feature.</p>
<h2 id="2-every"><a class="header" href="#2-every">2. every()</a></h2>
<p>The <code>every()</code> function checks if all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function. It's similar to the <code>all()</code> function in Python.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let allPositive = numbers.every(num =&gt; num &gt; 0);
console.log(allPositive); // prints: true

</code></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>num =&gt; num &gt; 0</code> is our callback function.</p>
<h2 id="3-find"><a class="header" href="#3-find">3. find()</a></h2>
<p>The <code>find()</code> method returns the value of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let found = numbers.find(num =&gt; num &gt; 3);
console.log(found); // prints: 4

</code></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>num &gt; 3</code> is our callback function.</p>
<h2 id="4-findindex"><a class="header" href="#4-findindex">4. findIndex()</a></h2>
<p>The <code>findIndex()</code> method returns the index of the first element in the array that satisfies the provided testing function. If no values satisfy the testing function, it returns -1.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let foundIndex = numbers.findIndex(num =&gt; num &gt; 3);
console.log(foundIndex); // prints: 3

</code></pre>
<p>In this case, <code>num &gt; 3</code> is our callback function.</p>
<h2 id="5-includes"><a class="header" href="#5-includes">5. includes()</a></h2>
<p>The <code>includes()</code> method determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries, returning <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let includesTwo = numbers.includes(2);
console.log(includesTwo); // prints: true

</code></pre>
<p>This one doesn't require a callback function; instead, you pass in the value you're searching for.</p>
<p>In conclusion, JavaScript provides powerful built-in array methods that help you manipulate and work with arrays efficiently. A key aspect to understand is the use of callback functions within these methods.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="json-and-xml"><a class="header" href="#json-and-xml">JSON and XML</a></h1>
<h2 id="understanding-json-javascript-object-notation"><a class="header" href="#understanding-json-javascript-object-notation">Understanding JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</a></h2>
<p>JSON is a popular data format with diverse uses in data interchange, including that of web applications with servers. It is a text-based format, which is human-readable and easy to understand. JSON is language-independent and supports data structures such as objects and arrays, making it versatile and simple to use.</p>
<p>If you're familiar with JavaScript objects or Python dictionaries, you will find JSON to be similar. JSON's syntax is derived from JavaScript object notation syntax, but it does not require JavaScript to read or write because it is a text format that is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Language-agnostic">language-agnostic.</a></p>
<p>Here's an example of what a JSON object might look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;John Doe&quot;,
    &quot;age&quot;: 30,
    &quot;isStudent&quot;: false,
    &quot;courses&quot;: [&quot;math&quot;, &quot;english&quot;, &quot;programming&quot;]
}
</code></pre>
<p>Just like JavaScript objects or Python dictionaries, JSON uses key-value pairs to store data.</p>
<h3 id="json-vs-javascript-objectspython-dictionaries"><a class="header" href="#json-vs-javascript-objectspython-dictionaries">JSON vs. JavaScript Objects/Python Dictionaries</a></h3>
<p>While JSON may look like a JavaScript object or a Python dictionary, there are some differences.</p>
<ul>
<li>In JSON, keys must be strings. They are written in double quotes <code>&quot; &quot;</code>. This is not a requirement in JavaScript objects or Python dictionaries.</li>
<li>JSON cannot store methods or functions, unlike JavaScript objects or Python dictionaries which can.</li>
<li>JSON only allows a limited set of data types: string, number, object (a JSON object), array, boolean, null.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="xml-extensible-markup-language"><a class="header" href="#xml-extensible-markup-language">XML (eXtensible Markup Language)</a></h2>
<p>XML, like JSON, is a markup language used for encoding data in a format that is both human and machine-readable. XML was designed to carry data, not to display data. This means that it has no predefined tags, and you define your own.</p>
<p>Here's an example of what an XML document might look like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;person&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;John Doe&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;age&gt;30&lt;/age&gt;
  &lt;isStudent&gt;false&lt;/isStudent&gt;
  &lt;courses&gt;
    &lt;course&gt;math&lt;/course&gt;
    &lt;course&gt;english&lt;/course&gt;
    &lt;course&gt;programming&lt;/course&gt;
  &lt;/courses&gt;
&lt;/person&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In XML, the tags are not predefined like in HTML; you have to define your own tags. Also, unlike JSON, XML does not use arrays, but you can replicate an array structure by grouping elements within an element, as shown in the example above.</p>
<h3 id="xml-vs-json"><a class="header" href="#xml-vs-json">XML vs. JSON</a></h3>
<p>While XML and JSON can be used to achieve similar goals, there are differences that can make one more suitable than the other depending on the application.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Readability</strong>: JSON tends to be easier for humans to read and write than XML because it is less verbose.</li>
<li><strong>Data Types</strong>: XML does not provide explicit support for data types. Everything in an XML document is a string. JSON, on the other hand, provides support for data types like numbers and booleans.</li>
<li><strong>Metadata</strong>: XML allows for the use of attributes that provide metadata about the data it is encoding. JSON does not have a built-in capability for this.</li>
<li><strong>Namespaces</strong>: XML supports namespaces which can be useful when combining documents with different schemas. JSON does not have this feature.</li>
<li><strong>Array Representation</strong>: As mentioned XML does not have built-in support for arrays, but JSON does.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is an example of the same data structure (person) represented in both ways:</p>
<p>JSON:</p>
<pre><code class="language-json">{
    &quot;name&quot;: &quot;John Doe&quot;,
    &quot;age&quot;: 30,
    &quot;isStudent&quot;: false,
    &quot;courses&quot;: [&quot;math&quot;, &quot;english&quot;, &quot;programming&quot;]
}
</code></pre>
<p>XML:</p>
<pre><code class="language-xml">&lt;person&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;John Doe&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;age&gt;30&lt;/age&gt;
  &lt;isStudent&gt;false&lt;/isStudent&gt;
  &lt;courses&gt;
    &lt;course&gt;math&lt;/course&gt;
    &lt;course&gt;english&lt;/course&gt;
    &lt;course&gt;programming&lt;/course&gt;
  &lt;/courses&gt;
&lt;/person&gt;

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-is-a-spa"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-spa">What is a SPA</a></h1>
<h2 id="what-is-a-single-page-application-spa"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-single-page-application-spa">What is a Single-Page Application (SPA)?</a></h2>
<p>In the world of web development, a Single Page Application (SPA) is a type of web application that fits on a single web page. All your necessary code (HTML, JavaScript, and CSS) is retrieved with a single page load, or the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary, usually in response to user actions.</p>
<p>The goal of a SPA is to provide a user experience that's similar to a desktop application. In a SPA, all the necessary code for the page is loaded only once and its display is updated dynamically, meaning that the page doesn't need to reload when the user interacts with it. This leads to a more fluid and faster experience for the user.</p>
<p>Here is a video to give a wider understanding:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEpfiGu1f8g&amp;t=20s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEpfiGu1f8g&amp;t=20s</a></p>
<h2 id="how-does-a-spa-work"><a class="header" href="#how-does-a-spa-work">How does a SPA work?</a></h2>
<p>Traditional web pages require reloading the entire page to fetch new content. This was not only inefficient but also resulted in a clunky and less-than-optimal user experience. In a SPA, only the necessary content is updated.</p>
<p>When a user clicks on a link or interacts with the site, JavaScript will intercept that interaction and prevent the browser from reloading the page. Then, it fetches the necessary data (typically in JSON format) via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3l13qGLTgNw">Ajax</a> calls to the server. The new data is then used to update the web page dynamically.</p>
<p><img src="lessons/introduction-to-react/why-react/./what-is-a-spa/untitled.png" alt="Untitled" /></p>
<p>The beauty of this approach is that only the part of the page that needs to change is updated, resulting in less data being transferred and providing a smoother and faster experience for the user.</p>
<h3 id="spa-and-react"><a class="header" href="#spa-and-react">SPA and React</a></h3>
<p>Very simple, React will help us to build SPA applications. Is a library that will give us tools to build SPAs in a very easy and pragmatic way.</p>
<h2 id="examples-of-single-page-applications"><a class="header" href="#examples-of-single-page-applications">Examples of Single-Page Applications</a></h2>
<p>You probably use SPAs every day without even realizing it! Gmail, Google Maps, Facebook, and Twitter are all examples of popular SPAs.</p>
<p>To summarize, SPAs are a great choice for developing modern, user-friendly web applications. However, they also present their own unique set of challenges. Understanding these benefits and challenges will help you decide when to use a SPA and how to overcome potential obstacles in your projects.</p>
<p>React, Angular, and Vue.js are currently the most popular JavaScript frameworks for building SPAs. As you continue to learn more about web development, you'll undoubtedly gain hands-on experience with these technologies and the SPA architecture.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="benefits-and-disadvantages-of-spas"><a class="header" href="#benefits-and-disadvantages-of-spas">Benefits and Disadvantages of SPAs</a></h1>
<h2 id="advantages-of-single-page-applications"><a class="header" href="#advantages-of-single-page-applications">Advantages of Single-Page Applications</a></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Speed and Responsiveness</strong>: Since most resources (HTML/CSS/Scripts) are only loaded once, and only data is transmitted back and forth, SPAs can be significantly faster and more responsive than traditional web applications.</li>
<li><strong>Simplified and Streamlined Development</strong>: SPAs can be easier to develop because you don't need to write code to render pages on the server. You can use the same backend code to generate data for both your web application and your API.</li>
<li><strong>Improved User Experience</strong>: With no page reloads and fast transitions, SPAs can provide a superior user experience that's similar to a desktop or mobile app.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="disadvantages-of-single-page-applications"><a class="header" href="#disadvantages-of-single-page-applications">Disadvantages of Single-Page Applications</a></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>SEO</strong>: Historically, SPAs have had a difficult time with search engine optimization (SEO) because not all search engines execute JavaScript during crawling, and thus, may not index all the content.</li>
<li><strong>Initial Load Time</strong>: SPAs can have a slower first-page load time since the entire application needs to be loaded upfront.</li>
<li><strong>Browser History</strong>: Managing browser history can be difficult in a SPA. Because pages don't reload, the browser's back button may not work as expected without extra work.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="why-react-are-there-other-tools"><a class="header" href="#why-react-are-there-other-tools">Why React? Are there Other Tools?</a></h1>
<p>When it comes to choosing a JavaScript library or framework for building user interfaces, developers have a plethora of options. React, Angular, and Vue are among the top choices in the current market. Each of these tools has its strengths and weaknesses, and the best choice often depends on the specific requirements of the project. However, React has seen a surge in popularity and demand in recent years, and for good reason.</p>
<h2 id="why-choose-react"><a class="header" href="#why-choose-react">Why Choose React?</a></h2>
<h3 id="1-efficiency-and-performance"><a class="header" href="#1-efficiency-and-performance">1. Efficiency and Performance</a></h3>
<p>React uses a virtual DOM, which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. This leads to a significant improvement in app performance because React manipulates the virtual DOM instead of the actual DOM, reducing the load on the browser.</p>
<h3 id="2-component-based-architecture"><a class="header" href="#2-component-based-architecture">2. Component-Based Architecture</a></h3>
<p>React follows a component-based architecture. This means you can break down your application into small encapsulated parts which can then be composed to make more complex UIs. This promotes code reuse and makes your application easier to develop and maintain.</p>
<h3 id="3-backed-by-facebook"><a class="header" href="#3-backed-by-facebook">3. Backed by Facebook</a></h3>
<p>React is maintained by Facebook, and it's used in production by Facebook and Instagram. This means that it's constantly being updated and improved, and you can be confident that it's not going to disappear overnight.</p>
<h3 id="4-rich-ecosystem"><a class="header" href="#4-rich-ecosystem">4. Rich Ecosystem</a></h3>
<p>React has a rich ecosystem with a vast array of libraries that can be used alongside it to speed up the development process. Some notable ones include Redux for state management and React Router for routing.</p>
<h3 id="5-job-market"><a class="header" href="#5-job-market">5. Job Market</a></h3>
<p>React developers are in high demand. According to the 2020 Stack Overflow Developer Survey, React is the most loved and wanted web framework by developers. Its popularity among businesses and developers means there are numerous job opportunities for React developers.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-react-compare-to-angular-and-vue"><a class="header" href="#how-does-react-compare-to-angular-and-vue">How Does React Compare to Angular and Vue?</a></h2>
<p>While React is a library, Angular is a full-fledged MVC framework. This means that Angular provides a lot more out of the box, but it also has a steeper learning curve. Angular applications tend to be more rigid in their structure, while React offers more flexibility. Angular is also maintained by a tech giant - Google.</p>
<p>Vue, on the other hand, is designed to be progressive. It was designed from the ground up to be incrementally adoptable. The core library focuses on the view layer only and is easy to integrate with other libraries or existing projects. Vue is easier to learn than both React and Angular. However, it's not backed by a large company like React or Angular, and its job market is currently smaller.</p>
<p>Here is a very nice comparative video:</p>
<div style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0;"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/T2uKprwHHXU" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"></iframe></div>
<p>In conclusion, while there are other excellent tools available for building SPAs, React stands out for its efficiency, flexibility, strong community support, and demand in the job market. It's a fantastic tool for both beginners looking to break into web development and seasoned developers looking to expand their toolkit.</p>

<p>Alright, let's dive deeper into React!</p>
<p>First, we'll discuss what React is. Why is it everywhere and what's the big deal about it?</p>
<p>Once we understand that, we'll get our hands dirty. We're going to set up our very first React project.</p>
<p>With our project ready, we'll create our first component. Think of components like building blocks for our app.</p>
<p>Next, we'll touch on JSX. It might look like a mix of HTML and JavaScript, and well, it kind of is! We'll see how it works with React.</p>
<p>Of course, we want our apps to look good, so we'll explore how we can use CSS with React.</p>
<p>React is also all about interaction. We'll find out how React deals with events like button clicks or form submissions.</p>
<p>Lastly, we'll have a peek at the component lifecycle. It's about understanding how a React component is born, grows, and is deleted.</p>
<p>Let's jump in and learn together!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-is-react"><a class="header" href="#what-is-react">What is React?</a></h1>
<p>React, also known as React.js or ReactJS, is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications (SPAs) where you need a fast, interactive user experience. Originally developed by Facebook in 2011 for its news feed feature, React has since been open-sourced and is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.</p>
<h2 id="core-concepts-of-react"><a class="header" href="#core-concepts-of-react">Core Concepts of React</a></h2>
<h3 id="components"><a class="header" href="#components">Components</a></h3>
<p>React code is made of entities called components. Components are JavaScript classes or functions that optionally accept inputs, called props, and return a React element that describes how a section of the UI should appear. The encapsulated nature of React components makes them reusable, promoting a &quot;write once, use many times&quot; approach.</p>
<h3 id="jsx"><a class="header" href="#jsx">JSX</a></h3>
<p>React embraces the concept of JSX (JavaScript XML), which allows you to write HTML-like syntax directly in your JavaScript code. It is not a necessity to use JSX in React, but it is the recommended way of describing what the UI should look like.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function Hello() {
  return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;;
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="the-virtual-dom"><a class="header" href="#the-virtual-dom">The Virtual DOM</a></h3>
<p>One of the key aspects that makes React so performant is the concept of the Virtual DOM. Every time a React component's state changes, a new virtual DOM representation of the user interface is created. React then compares this new representation with the previous one and smartly updates only the parts of the real DOM that changed. This diffing process makes React applications incredibly fast and efficient.</p>
<h2 id="the-power-of-react"><a class="header" href="#the-power-of-react">The Power of React</a></h2>
<p>React has gained significant popularity among developers and companies worldwide due to its efficiency, flexibility, and strong community support. Here are some reasons why:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Easy to Learn and Use</strong>: If you already know JavaScript, picking up React can be straightforward. Its component-based approach can be easily grasped and allows for the creation of complex user interfaces from simple, isolated pieces of code.</li>
<li><strong>Reusable Components</strong>: Components can be reused across different parts of an application, making development faster and the code more manageable.</li>
<li><strong>Fast and Efficient</strong>: The Virtual DOM allows React to update only the parts of the app that need to change when the state updates, making it highly efficient.</li>
<li><strong>Strong Community and Rich Ecosystem</strong>: React has a large and active community, which means that there are plenty of resources, such as tutorials and third-party libraries, available. It also implies better opportunities for getting help and support.</li>
<li><strong>Backed by Facebook</strong>: React is used in production at Facebook and Instagram, and it's actively maintained by Facebook, which gives developers confidence in its longevity and continued support.</li>
</ol>
<p>React, with its robust ecosystem, large community, and strong backing from Facebook, offers a great choice for developers looking to build modern, interactive web applications.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="creating-a-react-project"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-react-project">Creating a React Project</a></h1>
<p>We already used Vite, to create our Vanilla JS applications. We can also use it to create React Applications.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-new-vite-project"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-new-vite-project">Creating a new Vite project</a></h2>
<p>Full instructions are also described <a href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/">here</a></p>
<p>Run the following command in your terminal</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm create vite@latest my_project
</code></pre>
<p>Select in your terminal the type of Project you want (React) and then a Variable you need (JavaScript only)</p>
<p>This will create a new folder with all the required files to start coding with your React project.</p>
<h2 id="running-the-project"><a class="header" href="#running-the-project">Running the Project</a></h2>
<p>Once the project setup is complete, we can navigate into the project directory:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">cd my_project
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we can install the dependencies:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm install
</code></pre>
<p>Then, we can start the development server:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm run dev
</code></pre>
<p>Now, our React application should be running at http://localhost:5173</p>
<h2 id="structure-of-the-project"><a class="header" href="#structure-of-the-project">Structure of the Project</a></h2>
<p>The project created includes the following directory structure:</p>

│   ├── App.jsx
│   ├── favicon.svg
│   ├── index.css
│   ├── index.jsx
│   └── logo.svg
└── vite.config.js

</code></pre>
<p>Congratulations! You have successfully set up a new React project with Vite. Now you're ready to start building your React app.</p>
<p>Happy coding!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="our-first-component"><a class="header" href="#our-first-component">Our First Component</a></h1>
<p>Now, from the generated project, open the file <code>App.jsx</code>. It should look like this:</p>
<p><img src="lessons/introduction-to-react/intro-to-react/./our-first-component/screenshot-2023-06-08-at-17.53.16.png" alt="Screenshot 2023-06-08 at 17.53.16.png" /></p>
<p>Most of this code looks like HTML inside of a JavaScript function. But also look at line 21, they are mixing JS code (a JavaScript function) with HTML attribute.</p>
<p>How is this possible?</p>
<p>It's all done with <code>JSX</code>, a new file type we will learn about.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-is-jsx"><a class="header" href="#what-is-jsx">What is JSX</a></h1>
<p>JavaScript XML (JSX) is a unique syntax extension introduced by React that allows us to write JavaScript that looks like HTML.</p>
<h2 id="why-jsx"><a class="header" href="#why-jsx">Why JSX?</a></h2>
<p>JSX may seem strange at first, but it is a powerful tool that combines the best parts of JavaScript and HTML. With JSX, we can write components that are more readable and easier to understand at a glance.</p>
<p>Here are some benefits of JSX:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Familiar Syntax</strong>: JSX's syntax is very similar to HTML, so it's easy to set up and get going quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Inline Styles</strong>: In JSX, you can create inline styles using JavaScript objects and camelCased properties.</li>
<li><strong>Logic and Markup in One Place</strong>: Because JSX is a part of JavaScript, you can mix logic and markup in your component files.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="creating-a-react-component-with-jsx"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-react-component-with-jsx">Creating a React Component with JSX</a></h2>
<p>In the project we just created</p>
<h3 id="1-delete-all-the-contents-of-appjsx"><a class="header" href="#1-delete-all-the-contents-of-appjsx">1. Delete all the contents of <code>App.jsx</code></a></h3>
<h3 id="2-writing-your-component"><a class="header" href="#2-writing-your-component">2. Writing Your Component</a></h3>
<p>Now write the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import React from 'react';

function App() {
  return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;;
}

export default App;

</code></pre>
<p>What this does is it defines a new function <code>App</code>, which becomes our component. This function returns what we want to display in the browser - in this case, an <code>h1</code> tag with the text <code>Hello, world!</code>.</p>
<p>This is JSX! It looks like HTML, but it's JavaScript.</p>
<h3 id="3-checking-the-result"><a class="header" href="#3-checking-the-result">3. Checking the Result</a></h3>
<p>If you now run your React app by typing <code>npm dev</code> in the terminal, you should see the text <code>Hello, world!</code> on your screen.</p>
<p>Congratulations, you've just written your first React component using JSX!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="css-and-react"><a class="header" href="#css-and-react">CSS and React</a></h1>
<p>Styling in React is a bit different from traditional HTML/CSS/JavaScript development. In this article, we'll explore how to apply CSS styles in React.</p>
<h2 id="inline-styling"><a class="header" href="#inline-styling">Inline Styling</a></h2>
<p>React allows us to write inline styles on components using a JavaScript object. React's inline styles are written in camelCase as opposed to hyphen-separated. Also, since the styles are a JavaScript object, we enclose the entire style attribute in braces <code>{}</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">const myStyle = {
    color: 'white',
    backgroundColor: 'DodgerBlue',
    padding: '10px',
    fontFamily: 'Arial',
};

function MyComponent() {
  return &lt;h1 style={myStyle}&gt;Hello Style!&lt;/h1&gt;;
}

</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, we define our style as a JavaScript object and then pass it into our component using JSX curly braces. It's important to note that the style's property names are in camelCase.</p>
<h2 id="external-stylesheets"><a class="header" href="#external-stylesheets">External Stylesheets</a></h2>
<p>While inline styles are okay for small styling changes, most applications will require a full CSS stylesheet for their styling needs. You can include CSS stylesheets in your React component similarly to how you would in an HTML file.</p>
<p>First, create a new CSS file. If you're creating a CSS file for a component called <code>MyComponent</code>, it is common to name the file <code>MyComponent.css</code>.</p>
<p>Then, in your CSS file, you can add any styles you want.</p>
<pre><code class="language-css">/* MyComponent.css */
.myComponent {
  color: white;
  background-color: DodgerBlue;
  padding: 10px;
  font-family: Arial;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Next, import the CSS file into your React component file.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import React from 'react';
import './MyComponent.css';

function MyComponent() {
  return &lt;h1 className=&quot;myComponent&quot;&gt;Hello Style!&lt;/h1&gt;;
}

export default MyComponent;
</code></pre>
<p>We've included the stylesheet we wrote by using <code>import './MyComponent.css'</code> at the top of our component file. We then assign the class to our component using the <code>className</code> attribute.</p>
<h2 id="css-modules"><a class="header" href="#css-modules">CSS Modules</a></h2>
<p>CSS Modules are a popular system for modular and reusable CSS. A CSS Module is a CSS file where all class and animation names are scoped locally by default. This approach can be a more reliable method of styling React components because it ensures that styles don't leak to other parts of the application.</p>
<p>When using CSS Modules, filenames are usually written as <code>MyComponent.module.css</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import React from 'react';
import styles from './MyComponent.module.css';

function MyComponent() {
  return &lt;h1 className={styles.myComponent}&gt;Hello Style!&lt;/h1&gt;;
}

export default MyComponent;

</code></pre>
<h2 id="styled-components"><a class="header" href="#styled-components">Styled-components</a></h2>
<p>Styled-components is a library for React and React Native that allows you to use component-level styles in your application that are written with a mixture of JavaScript and CSS. This approach enables the full capabilities of CSS (like pseudo selectors) and the power of JavaScript to create dynamic styles.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import React from 'react';
import styled from 'styled-components';

const StyledH1 = styled.h1`
  color: white;
  background-color: DodgerBlue;
  padding: 10px;
  font-family: Arial;
`;

function MyComponent() {
  return &lt;StyledH1&gt;Hello Style!&lt;/StyledH1&gt;;
}

export default MyComponent;
</code></pre>
<h3 id="which-one-to-use"><a class="header" href="#which-one-to-use">Which one to use?</a></h3>
<p>In the beginning, while learning, start with <code>Inline CSS</code>, As you progress try different styles like external stylesheet and <code>StyledComponents</code>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="react-and-events"><a class="header" href="#react-and-events">React and Events</a></h1>
<p>React, being a JavaScript library, makes use of JavaScript's event system. However, there are a few differences in how React handles events compared to how they're handled in plain JavaScript. In this article, we will delve into handling events in React.</p>
<h2 id="react-events-are-camelcase"><a class="header" href="#react-events-are-camelcase">React Events are CamelCase</a></h2>
<p>In plain HTML, events are written in all lowercase. However, in React, events are written in camelCase.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">// plain HTML
&lt;button onclick=&quot;handleClick()&quot;&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;

// React
&lt;button onClick={handleClick}&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, notice how <code>onclick</code> changes to <code>onClick</code> when we transition from HTML to React.</p>
<h2 id="pass-functions-as-event-handlers"><a class="header" href="#pass-functions-as-event-handlers">Pass Functions as Event Handlers</a></h2>
<p>In plain HTML, you usually pass a string as the event handler. In React, you pass in the function itself, not a string. This is an essential distinction because it allows us to pass in complex functions with JavaScript logic, not just simple one-liners.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">// React
function handleClick() {
  alert('You clicked the button!');
}

function MyButton() {
  return &lt;button onClick={handleClick}&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Here, we've created a function called <code>handleClick</code> that alerts the user when they click the button. We then pass this function into our button as a prop.</p>
<h2 id="the-event-object-1"><a class="header" href="#the-event-object-1">The Event Object</a></h2>
<p>Just like in HTML, in React, you have access to the event object that triggered the function. This event object includes details about the event that just happened.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function handleClick(event) {
  alert('You clicked the button!');
  console.log(event);
}

function MyButton() {
  return &lt;button onClick={handleClick}&gt;Click me&lt;/button&gt;;
}

</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, we log the event object to the console whenever the button is clicked.</p>
<h2 id="other-events-1"><a class="header" href="#other-events-1">Other Events</a></h2>
<p>React supports all the event handlers that you can use in standard HTML, such as <code>onClick</code>, <code>onSubmit</code>, <code>onChange</code>, and many others. Let's take a look at the <code>onChange</code> and <code>onSubmit</code> handlers specifically:</p>
<h3 id="onchange"><a class="header" href="#onchange">onChange</a></h3>
<p>The <code>onChange</code> event is used in input elements such as text fields, text areas, and select options. It captures the changes made in the input field and can be used to update the state in a React component.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function MyForm() {
  function handleChange(event) {
    console.log(&quot;I Typed&quot;, event)
  }

  return (
    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; onChange={handleChange} /&gt;
  );
}

</code></pre>
<p>In the above example, the <code>handleChange</code> function executes the console log every time I type.</p>
<h3 id="onsubmit"><a class="header" href="#onsubmit">onSubmit</a></h3>
<p>The <code>onSubmit</code> event is used in forms when you want to handle the event where the form is submitted.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function MyForm() {

  function handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    alert('Form was submitted');
  }

  return (
    &lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit}&gt;
      &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;Submit&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
  );
}

</code></pre>
<p>In this example, when the form is submitted, it triggers the <code>handleSubmit</code> function, which prevents the page from refreshing (the default action when a form is submitted) and shows an alert.</p>
<p>In conclusion, handling events in React is straightforward and similar to handling events in JavaScript, with a few key differences.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="introduction-to-component-lifecycle"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-component-lifecycle">Introduction to Component Lifecycle</a></h1>
<p>React is a powerful JavaScript library for building user interfaces. One of the most important concepts in React is the component lifecycle.</p>
<p>In React, each component has several &quot;lifecycle methods&quot; that you can override to run code at particular times in the process.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-component-lifecycle"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-component-lifecycle">What is a Component Lifecycle?</a></h2>
<p>In React, a component lifecycle can be defined as the series of methods that are invoked in different stages of the component's existence. The lifecycle can be broadly classified into three parts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Mounting (Birth of your component)</li>
<li>Updating (Growth of your component)</li>
<li>Unmounting (Death of your component)</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="lessons/introduction-to-react/intro-to-react/./intro-to-component-lifecycle/untitled.png" alt="Untitled" /></p>
<h2 id="adding-a-lifecycle-method-to-a-component"><a class="header" href="#adding-a-lifecycle-method-to-a-component">Adding a Lifecycle Method to a Component</a></h2>
<p>Open the previous project you created.  We will add some code to the <code>App.js</code> so it looks like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">
import React, { useEffect } from 'react';

function App() {

    useEffect(() =&gt; {
      console.log(&quot;I mounted&quot;)
    }, []);

  return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, world!&lt;/h1&gt;;
}

export default App;
</code></pre>
<p>Now run the project in your browser and open the console. You will notice a log that says <code>I mounted</code>, that is because using the <code>useEffect</code> hook, we are adding the capability to our component to access the lifecycle and do operations before, during, or after it is created.</p>
<p>We will explore more about these new methods in future lessons.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-lifecycle-methods"><a class="header" href="#why-do-we-need-lifecycle-methods">Why Do We Need Lifecycle Methods?</a></h2>
<p>Lifecycle methods are critical for managing what happens before a component is created, while it is active, and when it is destroyed. They help manage resources efficiently, initializing resources when mounted, updating them when necessary, and cleaning up when un-mounted.</p>
<p>For example, if your component involves a real-time data subscription, you would start the subscription in <code>mounting</code> and close it in <code>unmounting</code> to prevent memory leaks.</p>

<p>This week, we will compare class components with functional components and understand the pros and cons of each. We'll dive into the concepts of props and state, two fundamental aspects of React that handle data and determine how our components render and behave.</p>
<p>Next, we'll introduce the useState and useEffect hooks. These hooks allow us to manage the state and side effects of our functional components. We'll also discuss how to render lists in React, an essential tool for displaying arrays of data on the front end.</p>
<p>By the end of the week, we will introduce the concept of React Hooks. Hooks are a powerful feature of React that allows us to use state and other React features without having to write a class. Finally, you will get a chance to apply all your knowledge to a project.</p>

<p>React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. The core philosophy of React revolves around the concept of Components. In this article, we'll dive deep into understanding components, their significance, how to create and reuse them, and more.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-components"><a class="header" href="#what-are-components">What are Components?</a></h2>
<p>Components are the building blocks of any React application. A component is a self-contained piece of code that manages its own structure, functionality, and render output. Each component in React is a JavaScript function that returns JSX (a syntax extension that allows you to write HTML in JavaScript).</p>
<p>Think of components as Lego blocks. Just as you can build various structures using different Lego pieces, you can build different UIs using different React components.</p>
<p><img src="lessons/thinking-in-react/./how-to-think-in-react/untitled.png" alt="Untitled" /></p>
<p>You’ll see here that we have five components in our app. We’ve italicized the data each component represents. The numbers in the image correspond to the numbers below.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong><code>FilterableProductTable</code> (orange):</strong> contains the entirety of the example</li>
<li><strong><code>SearchBar</code> (blue):</strong> receives all <em>user input</em></li>
<li><strong><code>ProductTable</code> (green):</strong> displays and filters the <em>data collection</em> based on <em>user input</em></li>
<li><strong><code>ProductCategoryRow</code> (turquoise):</strong> displays a heading for each <em>category</em></li>
<li><strong><code>ProductRow</code> (red):</strong> displays a row for each <em>product</em></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-components"><a class="header" href="#why-do-we-need-components">Why Do We Need Components?</a></h2>
<p>Components come with a variety of benefits that make them a crucial aspect of React. Here are a few reasons why we use components in React:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Reusability:</strong> Components can be reused, meaning you can create a component once and use it in multiple places without re-writing it.</li>
<li><strong>Simplicity:</strong> UIs are easier to understand and manage when they are divided into components, with each responsible for a specific functionality.</li>
<li><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Components render independently, meaning a change in one component doesn’t require a re-render of the entire page. This leads to a better user experience and improved performance.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="creating-and-using-components"><a class="header" href="#creating-and-using-components">Creating and Using Components</a></h2>
<p>To create a component in React, you define a new function that returns JSX. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function Welcome() {
  return &lt;h1&gt;Hello worl&lt;/h1&gt;;
}

</code></pre>
<p>This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single &quot;props&quot; object argument with data and returns JSX. We can then reuse this component in another part of our code like so:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function App(){
  return &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;Welcome /&gt;
    &lt;Welcome /&gt;
    &lt;Welcome /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
}
</code></pre>
<h2 id="real-world-examples-of-components"><a class="header" href="#real-world-examples-of-components">Real-World Examples of Components</a></h2>
<p>Almost every website you interact with daily is built using some combination of components. For instance, a website may have a <code>Navbar</code> component for navigation, a <code>Footer</code> component for the website's footer, a <code>User</code> component to display user information, and so on.</p>
<p>Here is an example of how a news website could be broken down into components:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>Navbar</code>: This component could include the logo and the navigation links.</li>
<li><code>NewsArticle</code>: This component could represent a single news article.</li>
<li><code>NewsFeed</code>: This component could use the <code>NewsArticle</code> component multiple times to create a list of news articles.</li>
<li><code>Sidebar</code>: This component could include information about the writer, popular articles, and other related information.</li>
<li><code>Footer</code>: This component would include links like 'About Us', 'Contact Us', etc.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="lessons/thinking-in-react/./how-to-think-in-react/untitled-1.png" alt="Untitled" /></p>
<p>When you visit a website, try to identify which parts of the website could be turned into reusable components. This exercise will help you get into the mindset of &quot;thinking in React&quot;.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion"><a class="header" href="#conclusion">Conclusion</a></h2>
<p>Understanding the concept of components is a fundamental aspect of becoming proficient in React. They help you organize your UI code into manageable pieces that can be understood, reused, and tested independently. As you continue your journey with React, you'll find yourself thinking in components, breaking down complex UIs into simple, reusable parts. This is a key part of &quot;thinking in React&quot;.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="class-and-functional-components"><a class="header" href="#class-and-functional-components">Class and Functional Components</a></h1>
<p>React gives us the flexibility to define components either as a class or a function. So far, we have been using functional components in our examples, but class components are another tool at our disposal. In this article, we will explore the differences between functional and class components, and when to use one over the other.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-functional-components"><a class="header" href="#what-are-functional-components">What are Functional Components?</a></h2>
<p>Functional components in React are just JavaScript functions that accept props as an argument and return JSX. Here's an example of a functional component:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function Welcome() {
  return &lt;h1&gt;Hello&lt;/h1&gt;;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Since the introduction of Hooks in React 16.8, functional components can now manage state and handle side effects, which were previously exclusive to class components.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-class-components"><a class="header" href="#what-are-class-components">What are Class Components?</a></h2>
<p>A class component is a more feature-rich way to define a component in React. It's written as an ES6 class and extends from <code>React.Component</code>. Class components can handle state and lifecycle methods, amongst other things. Here's an example of a class component:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return &lt;h1&gt;Hello&lt;/h1&gt;;
  }
}

</code></pre>
<h2 id="functional-vs-class-components-main-differences"><a class="header" href="#functional-vs-class-components-main-differences">Functional vs Class Components: Main Differences</a></h2>
<p>The primary differences between functional and class components come down to syntax and features. Here's a comparison:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Syntax:</strong> Functional components are simpler and easier to read and write, with less code than class components. Class components, on the other hand, require more boilerplate code, but offer more features out of the box.</li>
<li><strong>State and Lifecycle Methods:</strong> Before React 16.8, class components were the only way to have local state and lifecycle methods. Now, with React Hooks, functional components can also use state and mimic lifecycle behavior.</li>
<li><code>this</code> Keyword: In class components, the <code>this</code> keyword is used to access props, state, and methods. This can be confusing for JavaScript beginners. Functional components don’t require the <code>this</code> keyword</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="when-to-use-functional-components-vs-class-components"><a class="header" href="#when-to-use-functional-components-vs-class-components">When to Use Functional Components vs. Class Components</a></h2>
<p>With the addition of Hooks, functional components can do everything class components can do and more. Therefore, many developers prefer functional components for most cases due to their simplicity and conciseness.</p>
<p>In our class, we will use most of the time functional components.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="props"><a class="header" href="#props">Props</a></h1>
<p>In React, props are a powerful feature that allow us to pass data from parent components to child components. This article will explore what props are, why we need them, and how to use them with functional components.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-props"><a class="header" href="#what-are-props">What are Props?</a></h2>
<p>In React, &quot;props&quot; is short for properties. They are the arguments passed into React components, similar to function parameters in JavaScript. Props allow us to make our components more dynamic and reusable by passing data from parent components to child components.</p>
<p><img src="lessons/thinking-in-react/./props/untitled.png" alt="Untitled" /></p>
<p>Here is a simple example of how props can be used:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function Greeting(props) {
  return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {props.name}!&lt;/h1&gt;;
}

function App() {
  return &lt;div&gt;
    &lt;Greeting name=&quot;Emmanuel&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;Greeting name=&quot;Michael&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;Greeting name=&quot;Kodi&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/div&gt;
}

/***
Displays in the browser
Hello, Emmanuel
Hello, Mochael
Hello, Kodi
/*
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we define a <code>Greeting</code> component that accepts <code>props</code> as an argument. The component then uses the <code>props.name</code> property in its JSX. When we use the <code>Greeting</code> component, we pass a <code>name</code> prop to it, which then gets displayed in the browser. </p>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-props"><a class="header" href="#why-do-we-need-props">Why Do We Need Props?</a></h2>
<p>Props are fundamental to the concept of components in React. They allow us to:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Pass data</strong> from parent components to child components.</li>
<li><strong>Increase reusability</strong> of components. With props, we can write a single component and then reuse it with different data.</li>
<li><strong>Improve readability</strong> of our codebase. We can know what a component does by just looking at the props name.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="how-to-use-props-in-react-components"><a class="header" href="#how-to-use-props-in-react-components">How to Use Props in React Components</a></h2>
<p>Let's dive into some more examples of how to use props in functional components.</p>
<h3 id="passing-multiple-props"><a class="header" href="#passing-multiple-props">Passing Multiple Props</a></h3>
<p>You can pass multiple props to a component:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function Profile(props) {
  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;{props.name}&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;{props.bio}&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

function App() {
  return &lt;Profile name=&quot;John Doe&quot; bio=&quot;A web developer from New York.&quot; /&gt;
}

</code></pre>
<h3 id="passing-arrays-and-objects-as-props"><a class="header" href="#passing-arrays-and-objects-as-props">Passing Arrays and Objects as Props</a></h3>
<p>You can also pass complex JavaScript types like arrays or objects as props:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function List(props) {
  const items = props.items.map((item, index) =&gt; &lt;li key={index}&gt;{item}&lt;/li&gt;);
  return &lt;ul&gt;{items}&lt;/ul&gt;;
}

function App() {
  return &lt;List items={['Apple', 'Orange', 'Banana']} /&gt;
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="destructuring-props"><a class="header" href="#destructuring-props">Destructuring Props</a></h3>
<p>To make your code cleaner, you can destructure the props in the function signature:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function Greeting({ name }) {
  return &lt;h1&gt;Hello, {name}!&lt;/h1&gt;;
}

function App() {
  return &lt;Greeting name=&quot;World&quot; /&gt;
}

</code></pre>
<p>This syntax can be particularly useful when you have many props.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="state"><a class="header" href="#state">State</a></h1>
<p>React's state is one of the essential concepts you'll need to understand to build dynamic and interactive components in React. This article will explore what state is, why we need it, how it differs from props, and how to use the <code>useState</code> hook.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-state"><a class="header" href="#what-is-state">What is State?</a></h2>
<p>In React, state refers to the data that can change over time and affect the behavior or render output of a component. </p>
<p>One analogy I like is to think about your emotional state. It will change over time. It's rarely stable.</p>
<p>In other words, it's the component's memory. The state in a React component is a JavaScript object and can hold information that may change over the lifetime of the component.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-state"><a class="header" href="#why-do-we-need-state">Why Do We Need State?</a></h2>
<p>Without state, our components would be static and only depend on the props given to them. With state, our components become interactive and dynamic. For instance, state allows us to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Store user input</strong>: We can use state to remember the text that a user types into a form field.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="lessons/thinking-in-react/./state/untitled.png" alt="Untitled" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Toggle elements</strong>: We can use state to decide whether or not to show certain elements, such as a dropdown menu.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="lessons/thinking-in-react/./state/untitled-1.png" alt="Untitled" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Fetch and display data</strong>: We can use state to store data fetched from an API and update the UI when the data arrives.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="difference-between-state-and-props"><a class="header" href="#difference-between-state-and-props">Difference Between State and Props</a></h2>
<p>Props and state in React are both plain JavaScript objects holding information that influences the output of render, but they serve different purposes:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Props</strong> are passed to the component (similar to function parameters) and are immutable (they don't change) within the component.</li>
<li><strong>State</strong> is managed within the component (similar to variables declared within a function) and can be changed within the component.</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="usestate"><a class="header" href="#usestate"><code>useState</code></a></h1>
<h2 id="understanding-the-usestate-hook"><a class="header" href="#understanding-the-usestate-hook">Understanding the <code>useState</code> Hook</a></h2>
<p>The <code>useState</code> <a href="https://react.dev/reference/react">hook</a> (we will go deeper into hooks a un future lessons) is a function that lets you add React state to your functional components. </p>
<p>Here is a simple counter component that uses the <code>useState</code> hook:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;p&gt;You clicked {count} times&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(count + 1)}&gt;
        Click me
      &lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

export default Counter;
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, <code>useState</code> is called with the initial state as an argument (<code>0</code> in our case). <code>useState</code> returns a pair of values: the current state and a function that updates it. This is why we write <code>const [count, setCount] = useState(0)</code>.</p>
<p>The <code>setCount</code> function is used to update the state. When the user clicks the button, the click handler updates the state with the new count</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="components-lifecycle"><a class="header" href="#components-lifecycle">Components Lifecycle</a></h1>
<p>When it comes to building applications with React, understanding the lifecycle of components is crucial. Whether you're fetching data, managing state, or handling side effects, knowing how and when components render and re-render is key.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-component-lifecycle"><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-component-lifecycle">What is the Component Lifecycle?</a></h2>
<p>In a React functional component, the lifecycle can be distilled down to three stages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Mounting:</strong> The component is being created and inserted into the DOM.</li>
<li><strong>Updating:</strong> The component is re-rendering as a result of changes to either its props or state.</li>
<li><strong>Unmounting:</strong> The component is being removed from the DOM.</li>
</ol>
<p><img src="lessons/thinking-in-react/./components-lifecycle/untitled.png" alt="Untitled" /></p>
<p>React provides the <code>useEffect</code> hook to handle these lifecycle stages in functional components.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="useeffect"><a class="header" href="#useeffect">useEffect</a></h1>
<h2 id="using-the-useeffect-hook"><a class="header" href="#using-the-useeffect-hook">Using the <code>useEffect</code> Hook</a></h2>
<p>The <code>useEffect</code> hook in React allows you to perform side effects in functional components. Side effects could be data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM. The hook takes two arguments: a function that contains the side-effect logic, and an array of dependencies.</p>
<p>In it's simple form, it looks like this</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">useEffect( () ⇒ {} , [] )
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, it's just a function, that takes 2 parameters. The first in is a function. The second one is an array, a dependency array.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-the-dependency-array"><a class="header" href="#what-is-the-dependency-array">What is the Dependency Array?</a></h2>
<p>The dependency array is an array of values that the effect depends on. If one of these values changes between renders, React will re-run the effect. In other words, the effect &quot;subscribes&quot; to the values listed in the array, and whenever one of these values changes, the effect re-runs.</p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at the different scenarios:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>No Dependency Array:</strong> If no second argument is passed to <code>useEffect</code>, the effect will run after every render.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">useEffect(() =&gt; {
  console.log('This runs after every render.');
});

</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Empty Dependency Array:</strong> If the second argument is an empty array <code>[]</code>, the effect will only run once, similar to <code>componentDidMount</code> in class components.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">useEffect(() =&gt; {
  console.log('This runs once after the initial render.');
}, []);
</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Array with Dependencies:</strong> If the array includes one or more values, the effect will run whenever any of these values change.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">useEffect(() =&gt; {
  console.log('This runs whenever data or props change.');
}, [data, props]);
</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-the-dependency-array"><a class="header" href="#why-do-we-need-the-dependency-array">Why Do We Need the Dependency Array?</a></h2>
<p>The dependency array in <code>useEffect</code> allows us to optimize when effects are run. By precisely specifying what our side effect depends on, we can avoid unnecessary calls to the effect function, making our components more performant and preventing potential bugs.</p>
<p>Remember, if your effect does not depend on any values from props or state, you should pass an empty array <code>[]</code>, and React will call your effect once and then never again. If your effect does depend on some values, ensure they are included in the dependency array to instruct React to re-run the effect when these values change. Not doing so can lead to stale data and unwanted behaviors in your application.</p>
<h2 id="how-does-it-look-in-my-components"><a class="header" href="#how-does-it-look-in-my-components">How does it look in my components?</a></h2>
<p>Here's a simple example showing how you might use <code>useEffect</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function ExampleComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    fetch('&lt;https://api.example.com/data&gt;')
      .then(response =&gt; response.json())
      .then(data =&gt; setData(data));

      // this function executes only once, on after component mounts, note the empty dependency array [] down this line
  }, []);

  useEffect(() =&gt; {
    if (data) {
      console.log('Data updated!');
      // this function executes only when the data ( state defined above changes , note the dependency array with data variable as dependency [data])
    }
  }, [data]);

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      {/* display the fetched data here */}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

export default ExampleComponent;

</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we're fetching data when the component mounts (<code>useEffect</code> with an empty dependency array), and logging a message whenever the fetched data is updated (<code>useEffect</code> with <code>data</code> in the dependency array).</p>
<h2 id="cleaning-up-effects"><a class="header" href="#cleaning-up-effects">Cleaning up Effects</a></h2>
<p>Just like <code>componentWillUnmount</code> in class components, <code>useEffect</code> can return a function that will be used to clean up the effect. This is especially useful for subscriptions:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">useEffect(() =&gt; {
  const subscription = props.source.subscribe();
  return () =&gt; {
    // Clean up the subscription
    subscription.unsubscribe();
  };
}, [props.source]);

</code></pre>
<p>In this example, a subscription is created when the component mounts, and then it's cleaned up when the component unmounts.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="rendering-lists"><a class="header" href="#rendering-lists">Rendering Lists</a></h1>
<p>Rendering lists of data is a very common requirement in web applications. React provides an efficient and intuitive way to display collections. Let's explore how to do this.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-lists-in-react"><a class="header" href="#what-are-lists-in-react">What Are Lists in React?</a></h2>
<p>In React, lists can be created by rendering an array of <code>JSX elements</code>. In JavaScript, arrays are lists of objects. With React, we can transform these arrays into lists of elements.</p>
<h2 id="rendering-simple-numbers"><a class="header" href="#rendering-simple-numbers">Rendering Simple Numbers</a></h2>
<p>The most common way to render a list in React is by using the JavaScript <code>map()</code> method. The <code>map()</code> method creates a new array with the results of calling a function on every element in the original array. In the context of React, we use <code>map()</code> to transform an array of data into an array of JSX elements.</p>
<p>Here's an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function NumberList(props) {
	const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =&gt;
    &lt;li key={number.toString()}&gt;{number}&lt;/li&gt;
  );

  return (
    &lt;ul&gt;{listItems}&lt;/ul&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we have an array of numbers. We use <code>map()</code> to iterate over each number, and for every number, we return a new <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> element that contains the number. The result is a new array of <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> elements, which we then include inside an <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> element.</p>
<h2 id="keys"><a class="header" href="#keys">Keys</a></h2>
<p>In React, a key is a special string attribute that you need to include when creating lists of elements. Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity.</p>
<p>The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings. Most often, you would use IDs from your data as keys. Let's modify our previous example:</p>
<p>Here, we have assigned the <code>key</code> prop to each list item. Notice that we've used the <code>toString()</code> method to convert the number to a string. React requires that keys are strings.</p>
<h2 id="rendering-an-array-of-objects"><a class="header" href="#rendering-an-array-of-objects">Rendering an array of objects</a></h2>
<p>We can render this data as a list in React using the <code>map()</code> function as we've seen earlier. This time, we will access the properties of each person object</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function PeopleList(props) {
  const people = [
    { id: 1, name: 'Alice', age: 20 },
    { id: 2, name: 'Bob', age: 22 },
    { id: 3, name: 'Charlie', age: 23 },
    { id: 4, name: 'Dave', age: 24 }
  ];

  const listItems = people.map((person) =&gt;
    &lt;li key={person.id}&gt;
      {person.name} is {person.age} years old.
    &lt;/li&gt;
  );
  return (
    &lt;ul&gt;{listItems}&lt;/ul&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we're displaying each person's name and age in the list item. Each list item has a unique key — the person's ID. The <code>PeopleList</code> component is then rendered to the root DOM node with the people array passed as a prop.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="introduction-to-react-hooks"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-react-hooks">Introduction to React Hooks</a></h1>
<p>React Hooks are a significant feature introduced in the 16.8 version of React. They allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class component. They essentially let you <code>&quot;hook into&quot;</code> React state and lifecycle methods from function components. Before the introduction of hooks, these features were only available in class components, but hooks have enabled developers to write concise and readable code with function components.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-them"><a class="header" href="#why-do-we-need-them">Why Do We Need Them?</a></h2>
<p>Before hooks, developers had to switch between function components and class components depending on whether they needed to manage state or access lifecycle methods. This would often lead to inconsistency and confusion in the codebase. However, with hooks, developers can do everything with function components, allowing for a more cohesive codebase.</p>
<p>Furthermore, hooks allow developers to extract component logic into reusable functions, which promotes code reusability and organization.</p>
<h2 id="examples-and-use-cases"><a class="header" href="#examples-and-use-cases">Examples and Use Cases</a></h2>
<p>Hooks begin with the word <strong>'use'</strong>, which helps developers identify them in the codebase. The two primary hooks that come bundled with React are <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code>.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>useState:</strong></p>
<p>The <code>useState</code> hook lets you add React state to function components. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import React, { useState } from 'react';

function Counter() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    return (
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;You clicked {count} times&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(count + 1)}&gt;
                Click me
            &lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    );
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, <code>useState</code> is called with the initial state argument and returns a pair—an array with two items. The first item is the current state value (similar to <code>this.state</code> in class components), and the second item is a function to update it (similar to <code>this.setState</code> in class components).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>useEffect:</strong></p>
<p>The <code>useEffect</code> hook lets you perform side effects in function components. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

    // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
    useEffect(() =&gt; {
        document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
    });

    return (
        &lt;div&gt;
            &lt;p&gt;You clicked {count} times&lt;/p&gt;
            &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; setCount(count + 1)}&gt;
                Click me
            &lt;/button&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    );
}

</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, <code>useEffect</code> is used to update the document title each time the <code>count</code> state is updated. The <code>useEffect</code> hook is a replacement for the <code>componentDidMount</code>, <code>componentDidUpdate</code>, and <code>componentWillUnmount</code> lifecycle methods in class components.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>You can build your own hooks and explore other hooks that are included in React, but we will explore that in future lessons.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="intro-to-asynchronous-programming"><a class="header" href="#intro-to-asynchronous-programming">Intro to Asynchronous Programming</a></h1>
<p>Asynchronous programming is a critical aspect of modern JavaScript development, especially within the context of web development.</p>
<p>Do you remember using event listeners?</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">document.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, () =&gt; { console.log (&quot;hello&quot;) })
</code></pre>
<p>Or maybe you've done a API request using fetch:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">fetch(&quot;http://api.com&quot;).then(() =&gt; { console.log(&quot;my results&quot;) } )
</code></pre>
<p>If yes, you've done some asynchronous programming. But what is it exactly?</p>
<h2 id="what-does-asynchronous-mean"><a class="header" href="#what-does-asynchronous-mean">What Does Asynchronous Mean?</a></h2>
<p>To further understand the concept of asynchronous programming, let's draw a comparison to real-life conversations. Consider <strong>two types of conversation</strong>: <code>synchronous</code> (like a phone call or face-to-face conversation) and <code>asynchronous</code> (like an email exchange).</p>
<h3 id="synchronous-conversations-blocking"><a class="header" href="#synchronous-conversations-blocking">Synchronous Conversations (Blocking)</a></h3>
<p>In a synchronous conversation, like talking directly to someone, the process is blocking, i.e., you speak, then you wait and listen until the other person responds. While you're waiting for the response, <strong>you don't do anything else - you're blocked</strong>. </p>
<p><img src="lessons/asynchronous-javascript/./intro-to-asynchronous-programming/untitled.png" alt="Untitled" /></p>
<p>This would be analogous to synchronous programming, where the execution is halted until the ongoing operation is completed.</p>
<h3 id="asynchronous-conversations-non-blocking"><a class="header" href="#asynchronous-conversations-non-blocking">Asynchronous Conversations (Non-Blocking)</a></h3>
<p>Now, consider an asynchronous conversation such as an email exchange. You send an email and then carry on with your other tasks without waiting for a response immediately. When a response arrives, you handle it, but in the meantime, <strong>you're free to do other things.</strong> </p>
<p><img src="lessons/asynchronous-javascript/./intro-to-asynchronous-programming/untitled-1.png" alt="Untitled" /></p>
<p>This mirrors asynchronous programming: you kick off an operation, and rather than waiting for it to complete, you go on and execute other pieces of code. Once the result of the operation is ready, you handle it (usually using a callback, promise, or async/await in JavaScript), but you don't waste time just waiting.</p>
<p>This ability to overlap processing times for different tasks is what makes asynchronous programming so powerful and efficient, particularly in scenarios where tasks involve waiting for some external process — such as a server response, user input, or a file read operation — to complete.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-asynchronous-programming"><a class="header" href="#what-is-asynchronous-programming">What is Asynchronous Programming?</a></h2>
<p>Let's take an example, like clicking a button.</p>
<p>Imagine if you declare an event listener on click and you just held the button clicked. Should all the other operations in the program should stop?</p>
<p>Maybe a better idea is: When the operation is complete, your program is informed and given access to the result (if any).</p>
<h2 id="why-asynchronous-programming"><a class="header" href="#why-asynchronous-programming">Why Asynchronous Programming?</a></h2>
<p>Consider a typical web application. It might need to request data from a server, read files from the disk, and respond to user interactions, <strong>all nearly simultaneously!</strong></p>
<p>In a synchronous programming model, the JavaScript engine would execute one operation at a time, in the exact order they appear in the code. So, if a function needs to fetch some data from a server (an operation that can take a few seconds or even minutes), the entire application would stop and wait for this operation to complete before moving on to the next one. This would lead to a terrible user experience, as the application becomes unresponsive.</p>
<p>Asynchronous programming, on the other hand, allows the JavaScript engine to execute other tasks while waiting for long-running operations to complete. It keeps your application responsive and efficient.</p>
<p><img src="lessons/asynchronous-javascript/./intro-to-asynchronous-programming/untitled-2.png" alt="Untitled" /></p>
<h2 id="how-does-asynchronous-programming-work-in-javascript"><a class="header" href="#how-does-asynchronous-programming-work-in-javascript">How Does Asynchronous Programming Work in JavaScript?</a></h2>
<p><strong>JavaScript is single-threaded</strong>, which means it can handle one operation at a time.</p>
<p>Here is where the asynchronous nature comes in handy: JavaScript uses a mechanism called the event loop, which allows it to offload operations to the system kernel whenever possible.</p>
<p>When JavaScript encounters an asynchronous operation, like a network request, it sends this operation out to be handled by the program and continues to execute the rest of the code. Once the program finishes the operation, it sends a signal to JavaScript, which then runs a specified <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Callback_function">callback function</a> to handle the result.</p>
<h2 id="asynchronous-programming-in-the-wild"><a class="header" href="#asynchronous-programming-in-the-wild">Asynchronous Programming in the Wild</a></h2>
<p>As mentioned above, you've likely used asynchronous programming already if you've used the <code>fetch</code> API or any function that returns a Promise. Other asynchronous operations include <code>setTimeout</code>, <code>setInterval</code>, browser APIs (audio, video, geolocation) and many more.</p>
<p>In the following articles, we'll dive deeper into these topics and learn more about callbacks, Promises, async/await syntax, and how to handle asynchronous operations effectively in your code.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="synchronous-vs-asynchronous"><a class="header" href="#synchronous-vs-asynchronous">Synchronous vs Asynchronous</a></h1>
<p>Understanding the differences between synchronous and asynchronous programming is crucial when working in a language like JavaScript, which allows both models. This article will delve into the differences between these two paradigms and discuss why you might choose one over the other.</p>
<h2 id="synchronous-programming"><a class="header" href="#synchronous-programming">Synchronous Programming</a></h2>
<p>In synchronous programming, operations are performed sequentially. That means each operation is executed one after the other. When a function is called, the program &quot;waits&quot; for the function to complete its task before moving on to the next operation.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">console.log('First');
console.log('Second');
console.log('Third');
</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, 'First' is logged, then 'Second', and finally 'Third'. Each operation is performed in order, one after the other.</p>
<p>This model is straightforward to follow, but it can lead to inefficiency. For example, if you need to fetch data from a server, the entire program halts and waits until the data has been fetched, even if other parts of your program could be executing. (This is how Python works. It's inefficient)</p>
<h2 id="asynchronous-programming"><a class="header" href="#asynchronous-programming">Asynchronous Programming</a></h2>
<p>Asynchronous programming allows multiple operations to execute concurrently. If an operation is going to take a while (like a request to a server), the program doesn't wait around for it to complete. Instead, it can move on to the next operation. Once the long-running operation is finished, the program is notified and can use the result as needed.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">console.log('First');
setTimeout(() =&gt; console.log('Second'), 0);
console.log('Third');

// logs second, First, Third
</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, even though 'Second' appears before 'Third' in the code, 'Third' is logged before 'Second'. <strong>This is because setTimeout is an asynchronous function.</strong> It sets up a timer but doesn't wait for the timer to finish before moving on to the next line of code.</p>
<p>This model is efficient, as it allows the program to continue executing other code instead of waiting. However, it can be more complex to understand and handle, especially when dealing with dependencies between operations.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-each-model"><a class="header" href="#when-to-use-each-model">When to use each model?</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>Use <strong>synchronous</strong> code for operations that are quick and must happen in a specific order.</li>
<li>Use <strong>asynchronous</strong> code for operations that take a long time to run and don't need to block other operations, like network requests, file system tasks, or any IO-bound operations.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="callbacks"><a class="header" href="#callbacks">Callbacks</a></h1>
<h2 id="what-is-a-callback"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-callback">What is a Callback?</a></h2>
<p>In JavaScript, <strong>functions are first-class objects</strong>. That means you can do almost anything with a function that you can do with other elements, like numbers, strings, etc. You can pass functions as arguments to other functions, return them from other functions, and assign them to variables.</p>
<p>A callback function is a function that's passed as an argument to another function and is expected to execute at a certain time. The function that takes the function as an argument is often referred to as the higher-order function.</p>
<p>Let's take a look at a simple example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function greeting(name) {
    console.log('Hello ' + name);
}

function processUserInput(callback) {
    let name = prompt('Please enter your name.');
    callback(name);
}

processUserInput(greeting);

</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, the <code>greeting</code> function is a callback. We pass it to <code>processUserInput</code> as an argument. The <code>processUserInput</code> function then invokes or &quot;calls back&quot; the <code>greeting</code> function when it has finished gathering user input.</p>
<p><img src="lessons/asynchronous-javascript/./callbacks/untitled.png" alt="Untitled" /></p>
<h2 id="callbacks-in-the-dom"><a class="header" href="#callbacks-in-the-dom">Callbacks in the DOM</a></h2>
<p>When you want to respond to events on your webpage like clicks, mouse movements, key presses, or page load events, you will use callback functions.</p>
<p>Event listeners are methods we set on DOM elements to listen for specific events (like a button being clicked). The function that gets executed when the event occurs is a callback function.</p>
<p>Let's consider a simple example where we want to respond to a button being clicked:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">let button = document.querySelector('button');

button.addEventListener('click', function() {
  console.log('Button was clicked!');
});
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, <code>addEventListener</code> is a method that takes two arguments: the type of the event to listen for as a string ('click'), and a callback function to execute when that event occurs. When you click the button on the page, the message 'Button was clicked!' is logged to the console. The function we passed to <code>addEventListener</code> is the callback that gets executed when the 'click' event fires.</p>
<h2 id="callbacks-and-asynchronous-programming"><a class="header" href="#callbacks-and-asynchronous-programming">Callbacks and Asynchronous Programming</a></h2>
<p>Callbacks are heavily used in JavaScript for asynchronous programming. This is where an operation that takes some time to complete is initiated, but instead of waiting for it to finish, the rest of the code continues to run. When the operation is done, the callback function is called, or &quot;called back.&quot;</p>
<p>A classic example is the <code>setTimeout</code> function:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">console.log('Hello');

setTimeout(function() {
    console.log('World');
}, 2000);

console.log('Goodbye');

</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, 'Hello' and 'Goodbye' are logged to the console immediately. However, 'World' is logged after 2 seconds, due to the <code>setTimeout</code> function. This function takes a callback function as its first parameter and a delay (in milliseconds) as its second parameter.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="promises"><a class="header" href="#promises">Promises</a></h1>
<h2 id="problem-with-callbacks"><a class="header" href="#problem-with-callbacks">Problem with Callbacks</a></h2>
<p>While callbacks are very powerful, they can lead to what is known as &quot;callback hell&quot; if not managed properly. This is particularly true when you have a series of asynchronous operations that depend on each other. In these cases, each operation's callback contains another operation which has another callback, leading to heavily nested code. Check the following code:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">getData('data.txt', function(err, data){
   if (err) {
      console.log('Error:', err);
   } else {
      parseData(data, function(err, parsedData){
         if (err) {
            console.log('Error:', err);
         } else {
            saveData('parsedData.txt', parsedData, function(err){
               if (err) {
                  console.log('Error:', err);
               } else {
                  console.log('Data saved successfully!');
               }
            });
         }
      });
   }
});
</code></pre>
<p>Hard to say what is happening in what order. There might be a better way.</p>
<h3 id="enter-promises"><a class="header" href="#enter-promises">Enter Promises</a></h3>
<p>Promises were introduced to JavaScript as a solution to the &quot;callback hell&quot; problem. A Promise represents the eventual result of an asynchronous operation. It is an object that might return a value at some point in the future, or it might throw an error if the operation fails.</p>
<p>The previous example was rewritten with promises:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">getData('data.txt')
  .then(data =&gt; parseData(data))
  .then(parsedData =&gt; saveData('parsedData.txt', parsedData))
  .then(() =&gt; console.log('Data saved successfully!'))
  .catch(err =&gt; console.log('Error:', err));
</code></pre>
<p>A Promise can be in one of three states:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pending: The Promise's outcome hasn't yet been determined because the asynchronous operation that will produce its result hasn't completed yet.</li>
<li>Fulfilled: The asynchronous operation has completed, and the Promise has a resulting value.</li>
<li>Rejected: The asynchronous operation failed, and the Promise will not be receiving a resulting value. Instead, it has a reason for its failure.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="lessons/asynchronous-javascript/./promises/untitled.png" alt="Untitled" /></p>
<p>Promises enhance asynchronous programming by providing a simpler and more powerful way to handle asynchronous operations compared to callbacks. Here's why:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Chaining</strong>: Unlike callbacks, Promises are chainable. This means that you can link multiple asynchronous operations together, with each operation starting when the previous operation has completed. This makes the code more readable and manageable.</li>
<li><strong>Error Handling</strong>: With callbacks, error handling needs to be done individually for each operation. Promises, on the other hand, allow you to handle errors in a more centralized manner with the <code>catch</code> method.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="asyncawait"><a class="header" href="#asyncawait">Async/Await</a></h1>
<p>JavaScript has introduced <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> syntax that allows us to write asynchronous code that looks and behaves more like synchronous code. </p>
<h2 id="what-is-asyncawait"><a class="header" href="#what-is-asyncawait">What is Async/Await?</a></h2>
<p>Async/Await is a syntactic sugar on top of Promises, which makes asynchronous code look and behave a little more like synchronous code. This syntactic sugar leads to asynchronous, non-blocking code that appears a lot like synchronous, blocking code. This makes the code cleaner and easier to understand.</p>
<p>Async/Await is built on top of Promises. An async function always returns a Promise, and the resolved value of this Promise will be whatever you return from the function. The keyword <code>await</code> makes JavaScript wait until that Promise settles and returns its result.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-use-asyncawait"><a class="header" href="#how-to-use-asyncawait">How to use Async/Await?</a></h2>
<p>Remember the previous example in promises, this is how it's written in async/await</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">async function processData() {
  try {
    const data = await getData('data.txt');
    const parsedData = parseData(data);
    await saveData('parsedData.txt', parsedData);
    console.log('Data saved successfully!');
  } catch (err) {
    console.log('Error:', err);
  }
}

processData();
</code></pre>
<p>In the example above, the <code>async</code> keyword in front of the function means that the function will always return a Promise. Inside an <code>async</code> function, you can use the <code>await</code> keyword before a Promise to wait for its resolution.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-asyncawait"><a class="header" href="#why-use-asyncawait">Why use Async/Await?</a></h2>
<p>There are several reasons why you might want to use async/await:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Readability</strong>: Async/Await makes asynchronous code look like it's synchronous. This makes the code easier to read and understand.</li>
<li><strong>Error handling</strong>: With async/await, you can use <code>try</code>/<code>catch</code> blocks to handle errors, which is a more familiar syntax for error handling compared to Promises.</li>
<li><strong>Less noise</strong>: Async/await requires less boilerplate compared to raw promises, which can make your code more concise and easier to maintain.</li>
</ol>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="calling-apis"><a class="header" href="#calling-apis">Calling APIs</a></h1>
<p>Having a strong understanding of asynchronous programming in JavaScript is foundational to successfully making API calls. The <code>fetch</code> API, which you may have used before, is a perfect example of an asynchronous operation. This time, we are going to explore in detail how it works and what does it do.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-an-api"><a class="header" href="#what-is-an-api">What is an API?</a></h2>
<p>In the context of web development, an API is essentially a set of rules and protocols that <strong>define how software applications should interact with each other</strong>. APIs allow us to use functions and data from other applications without needing to understand their underlying codebase.</p>
<p><img src="lessons/asynchronous-javascript/./calling-apis/untitled.png" alt="Untitled" /></p>
<p>For instance, a weather app on your phone might use the API of a weather service provider to fetch the latest weather information. The API defines the way that the weather app should make requests to the weather service and how the data will be structured in the response.</p>
<p><img src="lessons/asynchronous-javascript/./calling-apis/untitled-1.png" alt="Untitled" /></p>
<h2 id="making-api-calls-in-javascript"><a class="header" href="#making-api-calls-in-javascript">Making API Calls in JavaScript</a></h2>
<p>JavaScript provides several ways to interact with APIs and fetch data, such as using the <code>fetch</code> API, XMLHttp requests, or libraries like Axios. But for simplicity, we'll focus on the <code>fetch</code> API (this is provided by the browser)</p>
<p>The fetch API is built into most modern browsers and provides a powerful, flexible method for fetching resources asynchronously across the network. The <code>fetch()</code> method returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object representing the response to the request.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">fetch(&quot;&lt;http://api.com&gt;&quot;)
  .then(response =&gt; response.json())
  .then(data =&gt; console.log(data))
  .catch(error =&gt; console.error('Error:', error));
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, <code>fetch()</code> takes an API URL as an argument and returns a Promise, which fulfills with a Response object once the server responds.</p>
<p>The <code>then()</code> method is then used to handle this Promise. The first <code>then()</code> block is used to convert the response to a JSON format (which also returns a Promise), and the second <code>then()</code> block is used to handle the resulting data.</p>
<p>If there is an error at any point in the process, the <code>catch()</code> block catches the error and executes a function to handle it.</p>
<h2 id="api-call-with-asyncawait"><a class="header" href="#api-call-with-asyncawait">API call with Async/Await</a></h2>
<p>Although Promises significantly improve the handling of asynchronous operations compared to callbacks, they can still lead to complex code structures when dealing with a series of asynchronous operations. Here is where async/await syntax comes to the rescue, offering a more synchronous-looking way to handle Promises.</p>
<p>Let's look at how we can re-write the previous fetch example using async/await.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(&quot;&lt;http://api.com&gt;&quot;);
    const data = await response.json();
    console.log(data);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error:', error);
  }
}

fetchData();
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the function <code>fetchData()</code> is declared as <code>async</code>, which means it will always return a Promise. Inside this function, we use the <code>await</code> keyword to pause the execution of the function until the Promise is resolved or rejected.</p>
<p>The <code>try/catch</code> block is used to handle any errors that might occur during the fetch operation or while converting the response to JSON.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="browser-apis"><a class="header" href="#browser-apis">Browser APIs</a></h1>
<p>Modern web browsers are a treasure trove of features and functionalities that extend far beyond mere page-viewing capabilities. Much of this functionality is provided through a variety of built-in APIs, which allow developers to tap into and utilize the browser's built-in features.</p>
<h2 id="what-are-browser-apis"><a class="header" href="#what-are-browser-apis">What are Browser APIs?</a></h2>
<p><strong>Browser APIs provide a set of rules and protocols that facilitate interaction with the browser's functionality</strong>. </p>
<h2 id="exploring-popular-browser-apis"><a class="header" href="#exploring-popular-browser-apis">Exploring Popular Browser APIs</a></h2>
<p>There are numerous browser APIs, each catering to different functionalities. Let's dive into some of the most widely-used ones, including the Geolocation API and others like the Web Storage API and Web Audio API.</p>
<h3 id="geolocation-api"><a class="header" href="#geolocation-api">Geolocation API</a></h3>
<p>The Geolocation API provides access to the geographical location of the device, given that the user grants permission. It is commonly used in applications requiring location-based features, such as maps, weather applications, local event listings, etc.</p>
<p>Here's a simple example of how to use the Geolocation API:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">if (navigator.geolocation) {
  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(position =&gt; {
    console.log(`Latitude: ${position.coords.latitude}`);
    console.log(`Longitude: ${position.coords.longitude}`);
  }, error =&gt; {
    console.error(`Error: ${error.message}`);
  });
} else {
  console.log(&quot;Geolocation is not supported by this browser.&quot;);
}
</code></pre>
<p>In this code snippet, we first check if the <code>geolocation</code> object is available on the <code>navigator</code> object. If it is, we use the <code>getCurrentPosition()</code> method to get the current geographical position. This method is asynchronous and takes two callback functions: the first one is called when the position is successfully obtained, and the second one is called if there is an error.</p>
<h3 id="web-storage-api"><a class="header" href="#web-storage-api">Web Storage API</a></h3>
<p>The Web Storage API provides mechanisms for websites to store data in the user's browser. Unlike cookies, which are sent with every HTTP request potentially impacting performance, data stored through the Web Storage API stays on the client.</p>
<p>There are two main web storage objects:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>localStorage</code> - stores data with no expiration time</li>
<li><code>sessionStorage</code> - stores data for one session (data is lost when the browser tab is closed)</li>
</ul>
<p>Here's a basic usage example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">// Store value
localStorage.setItem('name', 'John Doe');

// Get stored value
console.log(localStorage.getItem('name')); // Output: 'John Doe'

// Remove stored value
localStorage.removeItem('name');
</code></pre>
<h3 id="web-audio-api"><a class="header" href="#web-audio-api">Web Audio API</a></h3>
<p>The Web Audio API provides a powerful system for controlling audio on the web, allowing developers to choose audio sources, add effects to audio, create audio visualizations, and more.</p>
<p>Here's a basic example of playing an audio file using the Web Audio API: (Let's assume we have the following HTML audio tag in our document)</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">&lt;audio id=&quot;myAudio&quot; src=&quot;audio_file.mp3&quot; preload=&quot;auto&quot;&gt;&lt;/audio&gt;

&lt;button id=&quot;playButton&quot;&gt;Play&lt;/button&gt;
&lt;button id=&quot;stopButton&quot;&gt;Stop&lt;/button&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>The JavaScript Audio API can be used to control the audio playback:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">// Get audio element
const audio = document.getElementById('myAudio');

// Get control buttons
const playButton = document.getElementById('playButton');
const stopButton = document.getElementById('stopButton');

// Play audio
playButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
  audio.play();
});

// Stop audio
stopButton.addEventListener('click', function() {
  audio.pause();
  audio.currentTime = 0; // This line resets the audio to the beginning
});

</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we have two buttons controlling the playback of an audio file. When the &quot;Play&quot; button is clicked, the <code>play()</code> method on the audio object is invoked, starting the audio. Conversely, when the &quot;Stop&quot; button is clicked, we first invoke the <code>pause()</code> method to halt the audio, and then we reset the audio playback to the beginning by setting <code>currentTime</code> to <code>0</code>.</p>

<p>Welcome to Week 7, a crucial stage in your journey as we explore the ins and outs of State Management in React applications. This week, we'll delve into managing state at various levels, starting from component-level state to global state that is shared across the entire app.</p>
<p>We kick off the week with an introduction to React Router, a collection of navigational components that compose declaratively with your application. We'll learn how to structure our app's interface into a collection of 'pages', which we can then navigate through using React Router.</p>
<p>Our focus will then shift to advanced state management topics. We'll talk about why state management is challenging and explore solutions like global state, React Context, React Query, and useReducer to manage complex state logic in large applications. We'll also look at other global state libraries and the concept of encoding state in URLs.</p>
<p>At the end of the week, we'll put theory into practice with a project, where you will apply what you've learned about state management in a real-world context.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="react-router"><a class="header" href="#react-router">React Router</a></h1>
<p>Here we go! Ever wondered how to navigate between different pages in a single-page React app? It's not as easy as it sounds.</p>
<p>That's where React Router comes into play.</p>
<p>We're going to first understand what React Router is and why it's so important for SPAs (Single Page Applications).</p>
<p>After getting the theory part down, we'll jump straight into an exercise. This hands-on activity will help you get a solid grasp on implementing React Router in real-world projects.</p>
<p>Ready to make your React apps more navigable? Let's get started!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-is-a-react-router"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-react-router">What is a React Router</a></h1>
<p>You probably noted a problem in your apps, they are just used in one page. But in a normal website navigation, there are multiple pages. </p>
<p>In this lecture we will explore how to implement this multi navigation flow in a React application</p>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-to-learn-it-as-a-separate-lesson"><a class="header" href="#why-do-we-need-to-learn-it-as-a-separate-lesson">Why do we need to learn it as a separate lesson?</a></h2>
<p>In single-page applications (SPAs), such as those created with React, the entire page is loaded in the browser after the initial request, and then subsequent views are handled without any need for a page refresh. This makes these applications fast and seamless to navigate, providing a more fluid user experience. But without a full page refresh, how can we handle different views or pages in our React application? <strong>This is where React Router comes in.</strong></p>
<p>React Router is a standard library for routing in React. It allows you to set up routes that correspond to different components in your application. In essence, it provides the navigation functionality that we're used to in multi-page applications, but without the page reloads.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-a-router"><a class="header" href="#why-do-we-need-a-router">Why Do We Need a Router?</a></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Better User Experience</strong>: React Router allows users to navigate through the application without page reloads, offering a smoother and more interactive user experience.</li>
<li><strong>Improved Performance</strong>: Since only the necessary components are rendered rather than the entire page, using React Router often results in improved performance.</li>
<li><strong>Simpler Code Organization</strong>: React Router helps you structure your application in a clear and intuitive way. Each route corresponds to a specific component, which simplifies the understanding of your application's structure.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="benefits-of-using-react-router"><a class="header" href="#benefits-of-using-react-router">Benefits of Using React Router</a></h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Dynamic Routing</strong>: React Router handles dynamic routing out of the box, making it easy to create complex routes and URL parameters.</li>
<li><strong>Nested Routes</strong>: It also supports nested routes, meaning you can have views within views, which is a common requirement in complex applications.</li>
<li><strong>Transition Effects</strong>: React Router allows for transition effects when moving between routes, enhancing user experience.</li>
<li><strong>Redirects and 404 handling</strong>: It makes it easy to set up redirects, handle 404s, and protect routes based on authentication or other criteria.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="adding-react-router-to-a-vite-react-project"><a class="header" href="#adding-react-router-to-a-vite-react-project">Adding React Router to a Vite-React Project</a></h2>
<p>To add React Router to your Vite project, you first need to install it using npm or yarn:</p>
<pre><code class="language-bash">npm install react-router-dom
</code></pre>
<p>Then, you import the necessary components from <code>react-router-dom</code> and set up your routes in your main application component:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './components/Home';
import Contact from './components/Contact';

function App() {
  return (
    &lt;BrowserRouter&gt;
          &lt;Routes&gt;
            &lt;Route path=&quot;/&quot; element={&lt;Home /&gt;} /&gt;
            &lt;Route path=&quot;contact&quot; element={&lt;Contact /&gt;} /&gt;
          &lt;/Routes&gt;
    &lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;
  );
}

export default App;

</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we have two routes: the root route (&quot;/&quot;) which renders the Home component, and the &quot;/about&quot; route which renders the About component. The <code>Switch</code> component is used to render only the first <code>Route</code> that matches the current location.</p>
<h2 id="understanding----and"><a class="header" href="#understanding----and">Understanding <Router/> , <Switch/> and <Route/></a></h2>
<p>React Router provides several key components to create a routing system in your React applications:</p>
<h3 id="router"><a class="header" href="#router"><code>&lt;Router&gt;</code></a></h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;Router&gt;</code> component is the main component that wraps your entire application. This component creates a history object, which keeps track of the current location and re-renders the application whenever this location changes. There are a few different kinds of routers provided by React Router, but the one you'll use most often is the <code>&lt;BrowserRouter&gt;</code>, which uses the HTML5 history API to keep your UI in sync with the URL.</p>
<h3 id="switch"><a class="header" href="#switch"><code>&lt;Switch&gt;</code></a></h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;Switch&gt;</code> component is used to render only the first <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;Redirect&gt;</code> that matches the current location. This is important because without <code>&lt;Switch&gt;</code>, multiple routes could match a URL and render at once, which is generally not what you want.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following routes:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">&lt;Route path=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;
  &lt;About /&gt;
&lt;/Route&gt;
&lt;Route path=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
  &lt;Home /&gt;
&lt;/Route&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Without a <code>&lt;Switch&gt;</code>, both the About and Home components would render when the user navigates to &quot;/about&quot;, because &quot;/&quot; matches every URL. With a <code>&lt;Switch&gt;</code>, only the About component will render, because it is the first matching route.</p>
<h3 id="route"><a class="header" href="#route"><code>&lt;Route&gt;</code></a></h3>
<p>The <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> component is perhaps the most important component in React Router. This component renders some UI when the current location matches the route's path. When a <code>&lt;Route&gt;</code> matches the current URL, it renders its children (usually a component).</p>
<pre><code>&lt;Route path=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;
  &lt;About /&gt;
&lt;/Route&gt;

</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the <code>&lt;About /&gt;</code> component will be rendered when the URL is &quot;/about&quot;. If you want to render a component only when the path is exactly the same as the URL, you can use the <code>exact</code> prop:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">&lt;Route exact path=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
  &lt;Home /&gt;
&lt;/Route&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>In this case, the <code>&lt;Home /&gt;</code> component will only be rendered if the URL is exactly &quot;/&quot;.</p>

<p><strong>Diving Deep into State Management</strong></p>
<p>Alright, let's tackle a big one: managing state in React apps. If you've felt that passing around data and state can get complex, you're not alone.</p>
<p>First off, we'll explore why state management can be a challenging task in larger applications. It's not just you - it's genuinely hard!</p>
<p>Then, we'll touch on the idea of a global state. Think of it as a giant storage room where different parts of your app can pick up or drop off data.</p>
<p>We'll dig into React Context, a built-in tool that lets you share state and functions with any component, without passing props down manually.</p>
<p>Next, we'll introduce React Query, a tool to sync your app's data with a server, and <code>useReducer</code>, a more structured way to handle complex state logic.</p>
<p>But the world of state management doesn't end there. We'll also look into other popular libraries people use and discuss when and why to pick them.</p>
<p>Lastly, ever thought about storing state in URLs? It can be super useful, and we'll discover why.</p>
<p>Ready to become a state management ninja? Let's dive in!</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="state-management-is-hard"><a class="header" href="#state-management-is-hard">State Management is Hard</a></h1>
<p>Let's remember the concept of state in programming: <strong>It's a snapshot of values at a particular point in time.</strong> </p>
<h2 id="what-is-state-in-react"><a class="header" href="#what-is-state-in-react">What is State in react?</a></h2>
<p>In the context of React, state is an object that stores values which can change over time and affect the behaviour of your app (i.e a like counter). These values can be anything: numbers, strings, arrays, objects, or even other React components.</p>
<p>State in a React component can change over time, usually in response to user actions such as click events, form submissions, or API calls. When state changes, React re-renders the component (and any child components) to reflect those changes.</p>
<p>For example, think of a simple counter component. It might start at zero, and every time a button is clicked, the counter increments. This changing number — the count — is stored in the state of the component.</p>
<p><img src="lessons/state-management/advanced-state-managment/./state-management-is-hard/untitled.png" alt="Untitled" /></p>
<h3 id="state-handling-can-be-hard"><a class="header" href="#state-handling-can-be-hard">State handling can be hard</a></h3>
<p>But things can get complex. What if:</p>
<ul>
<li>We need a state value in a parent component?</li>
<li>While adding state, <code>App.js</code> starts to get very polluted with a lot of different states?</li>
<li>We need it into children component 3 or 4 levels down?</li>
<li>We need to connect APIs responses with state?</li>
<li>A state change triggers another state change?</li>
</ul>
<p>This complex problems are solved with different tools we will explore in the following lessons.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="global-state"><a class="header" href="#global-state">Global State</a></h1>
<p>While local component state is extremely useful, it doesn't solve every problem. State can be &quot;lifted&quot; up to parent components to be shared between children, but this can quickly become unwieldy. As applications grow larger and more complex, managing state can become harder.</p>
<p>In React, parent components communicate with child components through <strong><code>props</code></strong>. But what happens when a prop needs to be passed through multiple layers of components?</p>
<p>Consider a scenario where you have a deeply nested component structure. A top-level parent component might have some state that a child component several layers down needs access to. To get the state to this child component, you'd have to pass it down through all the intermediary components as a prop. This is known as <strong>prop drilling</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="lessons/state-management/advanced-state-managment/./global-state/untitled.png" alt="Untitled" /></p>
<p>To avoid prop drilling, global state comes in. A global state is a state that can be accessed from any component in your app, regardless of the component's position in the tree. This is incredibly useful for things like user authentication data, theme preferences, or data fetched from an API.</p>
<p>Global state can be a source of complexity, as changes to global state can affect many parts of your application. Properly managing these changes to ensure a consistent user experience is one of the challenges of complex state management.</p>
<p><img src="lessons/state-management/advanced-state-managment/./global-state/untitled-1.png" alt="Global store diagram. All state is centralized in a store and components talk directly to store. This avoids prop drilling." /></p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="react-context"><a class="header" href="#react-context">React Context</a></h1>
<p>React by default, comes with it's own library to handle global state, <strong>React Context.</strong></p>
<h2 id="what-is-react-context"><a class="header" href="#what-is-react-context">What is React Context?</a></h2>
<p>React Context provides a mechanism to pass data through the component tree <strong>without having to pass props manually at every level</strong>. In other words, it is designed to share data that can be considered &quot;global&quot; for a tree of React components.</p>
<h2 id="setting-up-a-context-with-an-exercise"><a class="header" href="#setting-up-a-context-with-an-exercise">Setting Up a Context with an exercise</a></h2>
<p>Let's assume we an app that requires to have a theme, dark or light.</p>
<p><img src="lessons/state-management/advanced-state-managment/./react-context/untitled.png" alt="Untitled" /></p>
<p>As some components will change color depending on the theme, we need to have this value, <code>dark or light</code>, <strong>available through all the app.</strong></p>
<p>Whiteout global state, we would need to pass down this values regardless the level of component deepness. </p>
<p>In order to avoid that, we can just set up a global state for this values, and just call the theme value when we need it. This is how it looks like, we are in <code>App.js</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">// App.js
import React, { useState } from 'react';

// Create a context and export it
export const ThemeContext = React.createContext();

// Create a provider component
export function App() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState('light');

	// Notice how OtherComponents dont pass down state with props
  return (
    &lt;ThemeContext.Provider value={{ theme, setTheme }}&gt;
			&lt;ThemedButton /&gt;
    &lt;/ThemeContext.Provider&gt;
  );
}

export default App;
</code></pre>
<p>In the example, first we need to create a context using <code>React.createContext()</code>. </p>
<p>The <code>Provider</code> component is used higher in the tree and accepts a <code>value</code> prop. Any component below the provider in the tree can access this value.</p>
<p>Once it's set up, you can access to the theme, and setTheme values, every where in the app without passing down props.</p>
<h2 id="using-the-context"><a class="header" href="#using-the-context">Using the Context</a></h2>
<p>Any component in the tree can now access the theme. In a children component, <code>ThemedButton</code>, notice how the  <code>theme</code> and <code>setTheme</code> variables can be accessed with out passing down the values from <code>App.js</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import React, { useContext } from 'react';
import { ThemeContext } from './App';

function ThemedButton() {
  const { theme, setTheme } = useContext(ThemeContext);

  function toggleTheme() {
    setTheme(theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light');
  }

  return (
    &lt;button onClick={toggleTheme}&gt;
      Switch to {theme === 'light' ? 'dark' : 'light'} mode
    &lt;/button&gt;
  );
}

export default ThemedButton;

</code></pre>
<p>Here, we're using the <code>useContext</code> hook to access the <code>theme</code> and <code>setTheme</code> from the <code>ThemeContext</code>. When the button is clicked, the <code>toggleTheme</code> function is executed, toggling the theme between 'light' and 'dark'.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="react-query"><a class="header" href="#react-query">React Query</a></h1>
<p>When building applications, we often need to fetch, cache, synchronize, and update server state in our React applications. Although you can manage all of these processes manually (with <code>react context</code> and <code>fetch</code>), It's very time consuming and complicated to set up. This is where libraries like React Query come in handy.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-react-query"><a class="header" href="#what-is-react-query">What is React Query?</a></h2>
<p><img src="lessons/state-management/advanced-state-managment/./react-query/untitled.png" alt="Untitled" /></p>
<p>React Query is a data fetching and state management library for React. It provides a set of hooks that enable you to fetch, cache, and update data in your React components without needing to handle all of the complex state management logic manually.</p>
<p>React Query offers several advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Out of the box global state:</strong> If you need your API data in multiple components (children or parents), you don't have to do anything extra (like set up React-context)</li>
<li><strong>Auto Caching</strong>: React Query automatically caches data in memory. This means that if you request the same data again, it will be retrieved from the cache instead of making another network request.</li>
<li><strong>Pagination and Infinite Queries</strong>: React Query has built-in support for complex use cases like pagination and infinite scrolling.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="react-query-example"><a class="header" href="#react-query-example">React Query Example</a></h2>
<p>Let's look at a simple example where we fetch a list of posts from an API.</p>
<p>Firstly, install React Query:</p>
<pre><code class="language-powershell">npm install react-query
</code></pre>
<p>Now, let's fetch the data using the <code>useQuery</code> hook from React Query.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import React from 'react';
import { useQuery } from 'react-query';
import axios from 'axios';

function Posts() {
  const fetchPosts = async () =&gt; {
    const res = await axios.get('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts');
    return res.data;
  };

  // useQuery('posts') in every component where you need posts (global state)
  const { data, status } = useQuery('posts', fetchPosts);

  if (status === 'loading') return &lt;p&gt;Loading...&lt;/p&gt;;

  if (status === 'error') return &lt;p&gt;Error :(&lt;/p&gt;;

  return (
    &lt;div&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Posts&lt;/h1&gt;
      {data.map(post =&gt; (
        &lt;p key={post.id}&gt;{post.title}&lt;/p&gt;
      ))}
    &lt;/div&gt;
  );
}

export default Posts;

</code></pre>
<p>In the <code>Posts</code> component, we use the <code>useQuery</code> hook to fetch posts from the server. The <code>useQuery</code> hook accepts two parameters: a unique key for the query and an asynchronous function that returns the data. In our case, the asynchronous function is <code>fetchPosts</code>, which uses axios to fetch the posts from the API.</p>
<p>The <code>useQuery</code> hook returns an object with several properties that you can use to manage the state of your component:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>status</code>: The status of the query. It can be 'idle', 'loading', 'error', or 'success'.</li>
<li><code>data</code>: The data returned from the query. It's undefined until the query succeeds.</li>
<li><code>error</code>: Any error that occurred during the query.</li>
</ul>
<p>We then use the <code>status</code> to display a loading message, an error message, or the data when it's available.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="usereducer"><a class="header" href="#usereducer">useReducer</a></h1>
<p>Managing state in a large application can become cumbersome. In particular, when state transitions become complex due to intertwined business logic, <code>useState</code> might not be the most efficient solution. In such cases, the <code>useReducer</code> hook provided by React can be an ideal solution.</p>
<h2 id="reminder-what-are-hooks"><a class="header" href="#reminder-what-are-hooks">Reminder: What are Hooks?</a></h2>
<p>React Hooks, are normal JS functions with superpowers. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. <code>useState</code> and <code>useEffect</code> are the most commonly used hooks, allowing us to handle component state and side-effects respectively.</p>
<h2 id="why-do-we-need-reducers"><a class="header" href="#why-do-we-need-reducers">Why do we need reducers?</a></h2>
<p>We need reducers when we have multiple state that is connected. Take a form as an example.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import React, { useState } from &quot;react&quot;;

function RegistrationForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState(&quot;&quot;);
  const [email, setEmail] = useState(&quot;&quot;);
  const [password, setPassword] = useState(&quot;&quot;);

  const handleSubmit = (event) =&gt; {
    event.preventDefault();
    // Handle form submission...
  };

  return (
    &lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit}&gt;
      &lt;input value={name} onChange={(e) =&gt; setName(e.target.value)} /&gt;
      &lt;input value={email} onChange={(e) =&gt; setEmail(e.target.value)} /&gt;
      &lt;input value={password} onChange={(e) =&gt; setPassword(e.target.value)}  /&gt;
      &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;Register&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
<p>If we add a few more fields, we will need a lot of <code>useState</code> making the code very hard to manage.</p>
<p>Now, this is how the problem would be solved with <code>useReducer</code></p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import React, { useReducer } from &quot;react&quot;;

const initialState = { name: &quot;&quot;, email: &quot;&quot;, password: &quot;&quot; };

function reducer(state, action) {
  return {
    ...state,
    [action.name]: action.value,
  };
}

function RegistrationForm() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  const handleChange = (event) =&gt; {
    dispatch({
      name: event.target.name,
      value: event.target.value,
    });
  };

  const handleSubmit = (event) =&gt; {
    event.preventDefault();
    // Handle form submission...
  };

  return (
    &lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit}&gt;
      &lt;input name=&quot;name&quot; value={state.name} onChange={handleChange} /&gt;
      &lt;input name=&quot;email&quot; value={state.email} onChange={handleChange} /&gt;
      &lt;input name=&quot;password&quot; value={state.password} onChange={handleChange} /&gt;
      &lt;button type=&quot;submit&quot;&gt;Register&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/form&gt;
  );
}
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see, there is not <code>useState</code> anymore, only <strong>one</strong> <code>useReducer</code>. </p>
<p>Let's explore this hook in detail.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-a-reducer"><a class="header" href="#what-is-a-reducer">What is a Reducer?</a></h2>
<p>This video explains the whole concept and it's use cases:</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK_Wqx3RnHk&amp;t=2s&amp;ab_channel=WebDevSimplified">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kK_Wqx3RnHk&amp;t=2s&amp;ab_channel=WebDevSimplified</a></p>
<p>So, in basic words. A reducer is a simple pure function that <strong>takes an existing state and an action as input and returns a new state</strong>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'INCREMENT':
      return state + 1;
    case 'DECREMENT':
      return state - 1;
    default:
      return state;
  }
}
</code></pre>
<p>The key characteristics of a reducer function include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>It does not mutate the existing state</strong>. Instead, it produces a new state based on the input action.</li>
<li><strong>It's deterministic</strong>. Given the same state and action, it will always return the same result.</li>
<li><strong>It handles every possible action</strong>. If the action type doesn't match any of the cases in the reducer, it should return the existing state as a default.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reducers are typically used with an <strong>action</strong>, which is an object that contains a <code>type</code> property and any additional data that might be necessary to compute the new state. For example:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">const action = {
  type: 'INCREMENT',
};
</code></pre>
<p>This is the full diagram on the useReducer architecture:</p>
<p><img src="lessons/state-management/advanced-state-managment/./usereducer/untitled.png" alt="Untitled" /></p>
<h2 id="understanding-usereducer"><a class="header" href="#understanding-usereducer">Understanding useReducer</a></h2>
<p>The <code>useReducer</code> hook is an alternative to <code>useState</code>. Accepting a reducer of type <code>(state, action) =&gt; newState</code> and returning the current state paired with a <code>dispatch</code> method, it helps us to manage complex state logic.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init);
</code></pre>
<p>This hook is usually preferable over <code>useState</code> when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. (like a form with a lot of fields)</p>
<h2 id="usereducer-simple-example"><a class="header" href="#usereducer-simple-example">useReducer Simple example</a></h2>
<p>Let's consider an example where we want to manage the state of a counter. Our counter can be incremented, decremented, and reset to its initial value.</p>
<p>First, we define our initial state:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">const initialState = {count: 0};
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we define our reducer function. A reducer function accepts the current state and an action, and returns the new state:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return {count: state.count + 1};
    case 'decrement':
      return {count: state.count - 1};
    case 'reset':
      return initialState;
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}

</code></pre>
<p>Now, we can use our reducer function in a component:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import React, { useReducer } from 'react';

function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);

  return (
    &lt;&gt;
      Count: {state.count}
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; dispatch({type: 'reset'})}&gt;Reset&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; dispatch({type: 'increment'})}&gt;+&lt;/button&gt;
      &lt;button onClick={() =&gt; dispatch({type: 'decrement'})}&gt;-&lt;/button&gt;
    &lt;/&gt;
  );
}

export default Counter;

</code></pre>
<p>In this example, we dispatch actions when the buttons are clicked, and our reducer updates the state according to the received action.</p>
<p>In conclusion, <code>useReducer</code> provides a robust way to manage complex state in your components. It helps make state updates predictable and maintainable, which is particularly useful in larger applications with more state logic.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="other-global-state-libraries"><a class="header" href="#other-global-state-libraries">Other Global State Libraries</a></h1>
<p>Due to the inherent complexity of state management, especially in large applications, a number of libraries and patterns have emerged to help manage global state. </p>
<p>In this course, we focused only 2 libraries, React Query and React Context. But there is more.</p>
<p>This is a non exhaustive list:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Redux</strong>: Perhaps the most well-known state management library for React, Redux offers a predictable state container that helps write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments, and are easy to test. Redux also has a great ecosystem and provides excellent devtools.</li>
<li><strong>MobX</strong>: This library simplifies state management by making it more reactive. In MobX, you mutate state directly, and the library takes care of updating any components that are consuming that state.</li>
<li><strong>Zustand</strong>: Zustand provides a minimalistic state management solution. It's lighter than some other solutions and includes features like middleware and devtools.</li>
<li><strong>Recoil</strong>: Recoil is a state management library from Facebook. It provides several advanced features, such as derived state and asynchronous queries, which can be beneficial in larger applications.</li>
<li><strong>Jotai</strong>: Jotai takes a unique approach by offering an atom-based state management solution. In Jotai, you manage individual pieces of state (atoms), and the library takes care of updating components when the atoms they depend on change.</li>
<li><strong>XState</strong>: XState takes state management in a slightly different direction by allowing you to model your state as state machines. This can make your state logic more predictable and easier to understand.</li>
<li><strong>Easy Peasy</strong>: Easy Peasy provides Redux with less boilerplate, using a simple, unobtrusive API. It's powered by Redux and Redux Toolkit underneath, but abstracts that away for a friendlier developer experience.</li>
</ol>
<p>These are just a few of the libraries available for state management in React. Each has its own strengths, weaknesses, and use cases, so the best choice depends on the needs of your specific project.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="state-in-url"><a class="header" href="#state-in-url">State in URL</a></h1>
<p>While using an application, users might want to share a certain view of the app or bookmark it to return later. In such cases, the application's state should be encoded in the URL. With <code>react-router-dom</code>, we can easily manage and manipulate the state in the URL, allowing our React application to be navigable.</p>
<h2 id="what-does-state-in-url-look-like"><a class="header" href="#what-does-state-in-url-look-like">What Does State in URL Look Like?</a></h2>
<p>State in the URL usually represents a particular view or condition of the application. It could be as simple as a specific page or as complex as various parameters determining a unique view. This is what makes applications &quot;bookmarkable&quot;.</p>
<p>Let's take an example of a shopping site. A URL with state might look something like this:</p>
<pre><code>https://www.shop.com/products?category=electronics&amp;sort=price_low_to_high&amp;page=2
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the state of the application includes:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>category</code>: electronics</li>
<li><code>sort</code>: price_low_to_high</li>
<li><code>page</code>: 2</li>
</ul>
<p>This URL points to the second page of electronics products sorted from lowest to highest price.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-handle-state-in-url-with-react-router"><a class="header" href="#how-to-handle-state-in-url-with-react-router">How to Handle State in URL with React Router</a></h2>
<p>React Router is a powerful library for handling routing in React applications. It provides various ways to handle state in the URL.</p>
<p>To handle state in URL with React Router, we typically use query parameters and URL parameters.</p>
<h3 id="query-parameters"><a class="header" href="#query-parameters">Query Parameters</a></h3>
<p>Query parameters appear after the <code>?</code> in the URL and are usually used for optional, unordered values. We can read query parameters using the <code>useLocation</code> hook from <code>react-router-dom</code>.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';

function useQuery() {
  return new URLSearchParams(useLocation().search);
}

function Products() {
  let query = useQuery();

  let category = query.get(&quot;category&quot;);
  let sort = query.get(&quot;sort&quot;);
  let page = query.get(&quot;page&quot;);

  // rest of your component
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="url-parameters"><a class="header" href="#url-parameters">URL Parameters</a></h3>
<p>URL parameters appear as variable sections within your path (i.e  <code>http://shop.com/articles/32</code>) They are used for required, ordered values and are defined in your routes. We can read URL parameters using the <code>useParams</code> hook.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import { useParams } from 'react-router-dom';

function ProductDetail() {
  let { productId } = useParams();

  // use productId to fetch or select product from state
}
</code></pre>
<h3 id="navigating-with-state"><a class="header" href="#navigating-with-state">Navigating with State</a></h3>
<p>In addition to reading state from the URL, we often need to navigate while preserving or changing this state. We can do this with the <code>useHistory</code> hook.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import { useHistory } from 'react-router-dom';

function Product({ product }) {
  let history = useHistory();

  function handleClick() {
    history.push(`/products/${product.id}`);
  }

  // in your JSX
  // &lt;button onClick={handleClick}&gt;View Details&lt;/button&gt;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Welcome to Week 8,  we'll start by discussing the concept of authentication flows and how they work in a modern web application. We'll then specifically focus on JWT, exploring what it is, how it works, and why it's beneficial for managing user sessions in web applications.</p>
<p>We'll examine the idea of protected routes in a React application and see how we can implement these using JWT for user authentication. We'll also look at how JWT integrates with React, especially in terms of storing and transmitting tokens.</p>
<p>The week culminates in a hands-on exercise that allows you to put into practice the concepts you've learned, followed by a project where you'll implement JWT authentication and protected routes in a React application.</p>
<h3 id="learning-objectives-8"><a class="header" href="#learning-objectives-8">Learning Objectives</a></h3>
<p>By the end of this week, you will be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understand what an authentication flow is and why it's needed in web applications</li>
<li>Understand what JWT is and how it's used for authentication and session management</li>
<li>Implement protected routes in a React application using JWT</li>
<li>Integrate JWT with a React application, including token storage and transmission</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="introduction-to-authentication-flows"><a class="header" href="#introduction-to-authentication-flows">Introduction to Authentication Flows</a></h1>
<h2 id="what-is-an-authentication-flow"><a class="header" href="#what-is-an-authentication-flow">What is an Authentication Flow?</a></h2>
<p>Authentication is a critical component of almost any web application. It's the process that confirms if a user is who they say they are. From a user logging into their email to a bank customer accessing their account, authentication is key to ensuring the right people have access to the right information.</p>
<p>In previous courses, you already covered how a traditional app flow works.</p>
<p><a href="https://web-app-development.vercel.app/lessons/auth.html">https://web-app-development.vercel.app/lessons/auth.html</a></p>
<p>In this flow, we have the front end and the back end on the same server--they are part of the same app.</p>
<p>However, when we work with SPAs we have a very clear separation between the front end and the back end. They live in two different code bases and servers.</p>
<p>It looks like this:</p>
<p><img src="lessons/jwt-and-react/./auth-flows-intro/untitled.png" alt="Untitled" /></p>
<p>Because of this, normally a different approach is chosen, we use something called JWT to handle our auth efforts.</p>
<p>In the next lesson, we will explore what JWT is.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="what-is-jwt"><a class="header" href="#what-is-jwt">What is JWT</a></h1>
<p>Traditional server-rendered applications usually handle authentication through sessions. When a user logs in, the server creates a session, stores it on the server side, and sends a cookie containing the session ID to the browser. For subsequent requests, the browser sends this cookie along, and the server validates it against the stored session information. This means the server will remember who is making this request.</p>
<p>However, this approach has its drawbacks when it comes to Single-Page Applications (SPAs) like those built with React. SPAs typically communicate with the server via APIs, which should be stateless (servers should  <strong>NOT</strong> remember who made requests) by design. They shouldn't maintain a server-side session for each user but rather handle requests that come with all the information needed for processing.</p>
<p>That's where JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) come in.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-jwt-1"><a class="header" href="#what-is-jwt-1">What is JWT?</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q17ubqLfaM&amp;t=768s">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Q17ubqLfaM&amp;t=768s</a></p>
<p>A great video that explains JWT flow.</p>
<p>In a JWT-based authentication flow, the server generates a token that certifies the user's identity and sends it to the client. The client then stores this token and includes it in all subsequent requests for validation.</p>

<h2 id="implementing-auth-flow-in-react-with-jwt"><a class="header" href="#implementing-auth-flow-in-react-with-jwt">Implementing Auth Flow in React with JWT</a></h2>
<p>Here's a basic overview of how we can implement JWT-based authentication in a React app:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>User Login</strong>: Capture user credentials and send them to the server.</li>
<li><strong>Token Generation</strong>: If the credentials are valid, the server generates a JWT and returns it to the client.</li>
<li><strong>Token Storage</strong>: Store the JWT on the client side. This is typically done in either local storage or in-memory, depending on your security needs.</li>
<li><strong>Protected Routes</strong>: Protect certain routes by checking if a valid token exists before rendering them. If no valid token is found, redirect the user to the login page.</li>
<li><strong>Sending Tokens</strong>: Include the token in the <code>Authorization</code> header when making requests to protected API endpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Token Verification and User Logout</strong>: The server checks the validity of the JWT on receiving an API request. If the token is invalid or expired, return an error response, prompting the client to log in again.</li>
</ol>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="protected-routes"><a class="header" href="#protected-routes">Protected Routes</a></h1>
<p>In single-page applications, certain routes should <strong>only</strong> be accessible to users who are authenticated (logged in), and these are called protected routes.</p>
<p>That means, in a React app, we will have some routes that will be only available to logged-in users. (Like a profile detail page). The routing would look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">&lt;BrowserRouter&gt;
  &lt;Routes&gt;
        &lt;Route path=&quot;public&quot; element={&lt;Login /&gt;} /&gt;
            &lt;Route
                path=&quot;private&quot;
                element={  
                    &lt;PrivateRoute&gt;
                    &lt;Profile /&gt;
                &lt;/PrivateRoute&gt;
            }
        /&gt;
    &lt;/Routes&gt;
&lt;/BrowserRouter&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>Notice the <code>PrivateRoute</code> component. The <code>Profile</code> component will only be accessible to authenticated users. This component takes a <code>element</code> prop and render this prop only if the user is logged in.</p>
<p>Here is a basic way of setting up the <code>ProtectedRoute</code> component:</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import { useContext } from &quot;react&quot;;
import { Navigate } from &quot;react-router-dom&quot;;
import { AppContext } from &quot;../App&quot;;

export default function PrivateRoute({ children }) {
    const { token } = // get token from any source (context,)

    /** this lines makes the magic */
    if (!token) {
        return &lt;Navigate to=&quot;/&quot; replace /&gt;;
    }
    
    return children;
}
</code></pre>
<p>If the user is authenticated, we render the component passed as a prop ( children ). If the user isn't authenticated, we use <code>&lt;Navigate&gt;</code> to redirect the user to a home page.</p>

<p>After all the theoretical introduction is time to see how we do this JWT auth implementation in react:</p>
<h2 id="step-1-user-submits-login-information"><a class="header" href="#step-1-user-submits-login-information">Step 1: User submits login information</a></h2>
<p>This typically happens in a login form, where users enter their username/email and password.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">import React, { useState } from 'react';

function LoginForm() {
  const [username, setUsername] = useState('');
  const [password, setPassword] = useState('');

  const handleSubmit = async e =&gt; {
    e.preventDefault();
    // ADD LOGIC TO LOGIN HERE
  }

  return (
    &lt;form onSubmit={handleSubmit}&gt;
      &lt;input
        type='text'
        value={username}
        onChange={e =&gt; setUsername(e.target.value)}
        placeholder='Username'
      /&gt;
      &lt;input
        type='password'
        value={password}
        onChange={e =&gt; setPassword(e.target.value)}
        placeholder='Password'
      /&gt;
      &lt;button type='submit'&gt;Log in&lt;/button&gt;

try{
      const { data } = await axios.post(
        'http://localhost:3000/session',

      setToken(data.token)
      navigate('/profile')

<h2 id="step-3-include-jwt-in-future-api-requests"><a class="header" href="#step-3-include-jwt-in-future-api-requests">Step 3: Include JWT in future API requests</a></h2>
<p>With the JWT stored, the app can now include it in the header of future API requests to authenticate the user.</p>
<pre><code class="language-jsx">try{
   const bearer_token = `Bearer ${token}`;

   const config = {
      headers: {
        Authorization: bearer_token
      }
   };

  const { data: posts } = await axios.get('http://localhost:3000/posts', config)

<h2 id="step-5-protect-routes"><a class="header" href="#step-5-protect-routes">Step 5: Protect Routes</a></h2>

import { AppContext } from &quot;../App&quot;;

<h2 id="step-6-logout"><a class="header" href="#step-6-logout">Step 6: Logout</a></h2>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Set up your React application.</p>
<p>Start by setting up a new React application using Create React App or another tool of your choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a Login Component.</p>
<p>This component should contain a form with fields for a username and password, and a button to submit the form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Submit Form Data.</p>
<p>When the user submits the form, send the form data in a POST request to the <code>/user</code> endpoint.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Handle Server Response.</p>
<p>If the username and password are correct, the server will respond with a JWT. Save this token in your application. This could be in the component state or a global state management system like Redux or Context.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Store the JWT.</p>
<p>Consider using a browser storage system like LocalStorage or SessionStorage to save the JWT. This way, if the user refreshes the page, the token won't be lost.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Authenticated Requests.</p>
<p>Use the stored JWT to authenticate future requests to your server. You will need to include the token in the <code>Authorization</code> header of your HTTP requests.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create Protected Routes.</p>
<p>Use React Router to create protected routes. These routes should only be accessible if a user is authenticated (i.e. if a JWT exists).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logout Functionality.</p>
<p>Add a logout button or link that, when clicked, removes the JWT from storage and un-authenticates the user.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Test Your Application.</p>
<p>Test your application thoroughly. Make sure that only authenticated users can access protected routes and that logging out properly un-authenticates the user.</p>
</li>
</ol>
